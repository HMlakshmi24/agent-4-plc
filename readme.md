# Agents4PLC
A Multi-Agent System for Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Code Generation based on IEC-61131 standard. The paper see:
[Agents4PLC: Automating Closed-loop PLC Code Generation and Verification in Industrial Control Systems using LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14209).

![Overview of our workflow.](pics/workflow.png)

## Dataset

The dataset is composed of benchmark dataset and RAG dataset, where released benchmarks are collected 
from open-source Github programs and we manually convert instruction into formalized and plcverif 
compatiable properties.

RAG dataset includes ST examples and tags are collected from [OSCAT dataset](http://www.oscat.de).

Industrial control documents and unreleased part of benchmark are collected from our partner companies
which are not prepared to be released.


## Source Code Organization

benchmark/ show the constructed tasks for plc code generation & verification task with patterns compatiable for plcverif verification.

result/ demonstrate the experiment statistics and detailed responses.

prompts/ contain specified prompts for each agent, including agent prompt engineering ways mentioned in our paper to 
enhance ability of agents.

LangChain/, MetaGPT/, LLM4PLC_reproduce/ or other folders corresponding to a certain multi agent framework's contain the implementation of the framework. You are free to create one for your own task, as long as the output satisfy the verification standards. (not available)

Notice: you should adjust content in config otherwise our framework could not work!

## Documents

For tools related to st compilation and smv verification not provided in src, see src/README.md.
For benchmark's construction process and how to use it, see benchmark/readme.md.

## Recommended Agent Related Tools & Works

Despite that our detailed code cannot be released due to cooperation with company, the following propose some recommended types 
to adjust multi-agent system, enhance ability of certain agents and reproduce experiments in out paper:
