# The problem is to design a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST) code that evaluates whether a critical motor should be triggered based on a given low pressure value. The function block should compare the input low pressure value to a defined threshold (36464) and determine the state of the output variable Motor_Critical accordingly.

# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Define a function block named FB_MotorControl.
2. Declare an input variable Pressure_LOW of type REAL, which represents the low pressure value.
3. Declare an output variable Motor_Critical of type BOOL, which indicates whether the motor should be triggered.
4. Declare a local variable Threshold of type REAL and initialize it to 36464, which is the comparison threshold.
5. Implement the logic to compare Pressure_LOW with Threshold:
   - If Pressure_LOW is less than Threshold, set Motor_Critical to TRUE (trigger the motor).
   - Otherwise, set Motor_Critical to FALSE (do not trigger the motor).
6. End the function block with END_FUNCTION_BLOCK.

<algorithm>
# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
# The algorithm to solve this problem is a simple Conditional Check.
# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

A Conditional Check algorithm is one of the simplest and most fundamental types of algorithms used in programming. It involves making decisions based on certain conditions, typically using 'if', 'else if', and 'else' statements. Here's a high-level tutorial on how to apply this concept:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Identify the conditions that need to be evaluated. In this problem, the condition is whether the pressure is lower than a certain threshold.

2. **Define Variables**: Clearly define the variables involved in the condition. You will usually have an input variable (Pressure_LOW) and a constant or comparison value (Threshold).

3. **Construct Conditional Statements**:
   - Use 'IF' to define the condition that needs to be checked first. 
   - Use 'THEN' to specify the action to take if the condition is true.
   - Optionally, use 'ELSE' to specify what to do if the condition is false.

4. **Implement Logic**: Write the logic in a structured manner in your chosen programming language, ensuring that the syntax is correct and that the logic properly reflects the problem requirements.

5. **Test**: After implementing the logic, thoroughly test with various input values to ensure the conditions are being evaluated correctly.

Conditional checks are used widely in all types of programming tasks, from simple decision making to complex decision trees. They are essential for controlling the flow of a program and making it responsive to different inputs and states.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The algorithm to solve this problem is a simple Conditional Check.

## Problem to be solved: 
The problem is to design a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST) code that evaluates whether a critical motor should be triggered based on a given low pressure value. The function block should compare the input low pressure value to a defined threshold (36464) and determine the state of the output variable Motor_Critical accordingly.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: Pressure_LOW = 36000
  Output: Motor_Critical = TRUE

- Input: Pressure_LOW = 37000
  Output: Motor_Critical = FALSE

# Planning: 
1. Define a function block named FB_MotorControl.
2. Declare an input variable Pressure_LOW of type REAL, which represents the low pressure value.
3. Declare an output variable Motor_Critical of type BOOL, which indicates whether the motor should be triggered.
4. Declare a local variable Threshold of type REAL and initialize it to 36464, which is the comparison threshold.
5. Implement the logic to compare Pressure_LOW with Threshold:
   - If Pressure_LOW is less than Threshold, set Motor_Critical to TRUE (trigger the motor).
   - Otherwise, set Motor_Critical to FALSE (do not trigger the motor).
6. End the function block with END_FUNCTION_BLOCK.
