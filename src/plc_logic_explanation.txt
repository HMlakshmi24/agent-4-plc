Certainly! Below is the Structured Text (ST) code template for the Siemens S7-1200 PLC based on the given requirements. This code includes variable declarations, logic conditions, and appropriate syntax for achieving the desired control behavior without direct hardware address assignments in the code:

```pascal
// Variable Declarations
VAR
    TankLevel : REAL;      // Real number variable to hold tank level
    OutletValve : BOOL;    // Boolean variable to control the outlet valve
    InletValve : BOOL;     // Boolean variable to control the inlet valve
    Pump : BOOL;           // Boolean variable to control the pump
END_VAR

// Logic to control OutletValve based on TankLevel
IF TankLevel > 80.0 THEN
    OutletValve := TRUE;
ELSE
    OutletValve := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Logic to control InletValve and Pump based on TankLevel
IF TankLevel < 20.0 THEN
    InletValve := TRUE;
    Pump := TRUE;
ELSE
    InletValve := FALSE;
    Pump := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Ensure all outputs are off when TankLevel is between 20 and 80
// The previous conditions already handle this, so no additional code required
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Declaration**:
   - Variables `TankLevel`, `OutletValve`, `InletValve`, and `Pump` are declared at the beginning. These will correspond to the PLC tags in the hardware mapping:
     - `TankLevel` as `%MW10` (Memory Word address).
     - `OutletValve` as `%Q0.0` (Output address).
     - `InletValve` as `%Q0.1` (Output address).
     - `Pump` as `%Q0.2` (Output address).

2. **Outlet Valve Logic**:
   - If `TankLevel` is greater than 80.0, `OutletValve` is set to TRUE, allowing the outlet valve to open.
   - Otherwise, `OutletValve` is set to FALSE, closing it.

3. **Inlet Valve and Pump Logic**:
   - If `TankLevel` is less than 20.0, both `InletValve` and `Pump` are set to TRUE, opening the inlet valve and turning on the pump.
   - Otherwise, both `InletValve` and `Pump` are set to FALSE, ensuring they are off.

4. **Additional Conditions**:
   - If `TankLevel` is between 20 and 80, the existing conditions ensure that all outputs (valves and pump) are turned off, meeting the requirement.

5. **Testing and Verification**:
   - In simulation, you can verify:
     - At `TankLevel = 10%`: `InletValve` and `Pump` should be TRUE.
     - At `TankLevel = 50%`: All outputs should remain FALSE.
     - At `TankLevel = 90%`: `OutletValve` should be TRUE.

This ST code is structured to ensure correct operation and should be verified in Siemens TIA Portal for successful compilation and simulation.
