Sure, I will guide you through creating Structured Text (ST) code for the Siemens S7-1200 PLC based on your requirements. Hereâ€™s how you can structure the code:

### Variable Declarations

Before implementing the logic, you will need to declare the variables in the TIA Portal environment following your mappings:

```plaintext
// Variable Declarations
VAR
    TankLevel : REAL;
    OutletValve : BOOL;
    InletValve : BOOL;
    Pump : BOOL;
END_VAR
```

### Logic Implementation

Next, you will write the logic using the Siemens ST syntax with IF / ELSE statements, ensuring each logic block ends with an `END_IF`.

```plaintext
// Implementing Tank Control Logic

// Logic for Outlet Valve
IF TankLevel > 80.0 THEN
    OutletValve := TRUE;
ELSE
    OutletValve := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Logic for Inlet Valve and Pump
IF TankLevel < 20.0 THEN
    InletValve := TRUE;
    Pump := TRUE;
ELSE
    InletValve := FALSE;
    Pump := FALSE;
END_IF;
```

### Explanation

1. **Tank Level Check for Outlet Valve**: 
   - When the `TankLevel` is greater than 80.0, the `OutletValve` is opened (`TRUE`).
   - Otherwise, it remains closed (`FALSE`).

2. **Tank Level Check for Inlet Valve and Pump**:
   - When the `TankLevel` is less than 20.0, both the `InletValve` and `Pump` are activated (`TRUE`).
   - Otherwise, both are deactivated (`FALSE`).

3. **Middle Range Handling**:
   - If the tank level is between 20.0 and 80.0, all outputs are set to `FALSE` due to the `ELSE` conditions setting them to `FALSE`.

### Testing and Verification

1. **Simulation at 10% (TankLevel = 10.0)**: 
   - The `InletValve` and `Pump` should be `TRUE`.

2. **Simulation at 50% (TankLevel = 50.0)**:
   - All outputs (`OutletValve`, `InletValve`, and `Pump`) should be `FALSE`.

3. **Simulation at 90% (TankLevel = 90.0)**:
   - The `OutletValve` should be `TRUE`.

Ensure to map these variables to the corresponding hardware addresses in the PLC tag table for real-world scenarios as per your provided mapping. This code should compile and work as expected in the Siemens TIA Portal environment for simulation and implementation.
