<description>
The task is to create a PLC function block named NOT_GATE using Structured Text (ST) that implements a boolean NOT gate. This block should have one boolean input ('Input') and one boolean output ('NegatedOutput'). The output should always be the logical negation of the input.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK NOT_GATE
  VAR_INPUT
    Input : BOOL;
  END_VAR
  VAR_OUTPUT
    NegatedOutput : BOOL;
  END_VAR

  (* The negation logic *)
  NegatedOutput := NOT Input;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define a function block named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare a boolean input variable named 'Input'.
3. Declare a boolean output variable named 'NegatedOutput'.
4. Implement the logic to assign the negation of 'Input' to 'NegatedOutput'.
5. End the function block.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used in this problem is a simple logic gate operation, which is a fundamental concept in digital electronics and computer science. The NOT gate is a single-input gate that inverts the input signal. The boolean NOT operation is straightforward and doesn't require complex algorithms like Dynamic Programming or Divide-and-conquer.

Tutorial:
1. **Understand Boolean Logic**: At the core of a NOT gate is the boolean NOT operation, which flips the value of a boolean variable (True becomes False, and vice versa).

2. **Structured Text (ST) Language**: This is a high-level programming language used in PLC programming. It is similar to languages like Pascal and can be used for implementing logic operations, making it suitable for writing control algorithms for industrial automation systems.

3. **Function Blocks**: In PLC programming, function blocks are reusable code blocks that can be used to perform specific tasks. They can be instantiated multiple times within a program.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define the function block with the appropriate name.
   - Declare input and output variables.
   - Implement the logic for the NOT operation.
   - Ensure that the function block is closed properly.

This specific implementation doesn't require complex planning as it involves a direct application of a logical operation. It's essential in control systems and digital logic design to ensure that inputs and outputs are correctly defined and the logic is accurately implemented.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The algorithm used in this problem is a simple logic gate operation, which is a fundamental concept in digital electronics and computer science. The NOT gate is a single-input gate that inverts the input signal. The boolean NOT operation is straightforward and doesn't require complex algorithms like Dynamic Programming or Divide-and-conquer.

## Problem to be solved:
The task is to create a PLC function block named NOT_GATE using Structured Text (ST) that implements a boolean NOT gate. This block should have one boolean input ('Input') and one boolean output ('NegatedOutput'). The output should always be the logical negation of the input.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- If Input is `TRUE`, NegatedOutput should be `FALSE`.
- If Input is `FALSE`, NegatedOutput should be `TRUE`.

## Planning:
1. Define a function block named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare a boolean input variable named 'Input'.
3. Declare a boolean output variable named 'NegatedOutput'.
4. Implement the logic to assign the negation of 'Input' to 'NegatedOutput'.
5. End the function block.
