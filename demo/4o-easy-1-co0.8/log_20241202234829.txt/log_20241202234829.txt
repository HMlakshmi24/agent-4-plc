# Create a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) that implements a boolean NOT gate. The function block should have one boolean input named 'Input' and one boolean output named 'NegatedOutput'. The output should always be the logical negation of the input.
</description>
<code>
# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Structured Text (ST) programming language.

1. Define a FUNCTION_BLOCK named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare the input variable within the VAR_INPUT section.
3. Declare the output variable within the VAR_OUTPUT section.
4. Implement the logic for the NOT gate where the output is the negation of the input.

Here is the code:

FUNCTION_BLOCK NOT_GATE
VAR_INPUT
    Input : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    NegatedOutput : BOOL;
END_VAR

NegatedOutput := NOT Input;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
# Planning to solve this problem.

1. Define the function block with the appropriate name: NOT_GATE.
2. Inside the function block, declare the input named 'Input' as a boolean type within the VAR_INPUT section.
3. Declare the output named 'NegatedOutput' as a boolean type within the VAR_OUTPUT section.
4. Write the logic to negate the input using the NOT operator and assign it to 'NegatedOutput'.
5. Ensure the function block ends correctly.

This structured text code will effectively create a NOT gate that outputs the negation of the boolean input.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
# This problem can be solved using simple logical operations, which do not require complex algorithms like Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, etc. Instead, it is implemented using basic logical negation.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

Logical Operators in Structured Text:
Logical operations are foundational in programming and control systems, particularly in PLCs. A NOT gate is a basic logical operation that flips the value of a boolean variable. In Structured Text, logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT are used to perform these operations.

1. NOT Operator: This operator is used to invert the value of a boolean. If a boolean is TRUE, the NOT operator will make it FALSE, and vice versa. It's a unary operator, meaning it only requires one operand.

2. Syntax: In Structured Text, the NOT operation is performed using the 'NOT' keyword followed by the boolean variable you wish to negate.

3. Application: Such logical operations are crucial in control systems where decisions need to be made based on certain conditions. By negating a condition, a control system can handle scenarios where a particular signal or condition is not met.

By understanding and using these logical operators, you can effectively control and manipulate the flow of your PLC programs.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next 
problem:
Logical operations using basic NOT operator

## Problem to be solved: 
Create a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) that implements a boolean NOT gate. The function block should have one boolean input named 'Input' and one boolean output named 'NegatedOutput'. The output should always be the logical negation of the input.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: TRUE, Output: FALSE
- Input: FALSE, Output: TRUE

## Planning:

1. Define the function block with the appropriate name: NOT_GATE.
2. Inside the function block, declare the input named 'Input' as a boolean type within the VAR_INPUT section.
3. Declare the output named 'NegatedOutput' as a boolean type within the VAR_OUTPUT section.
4. Write the logic to negate the input using the NOT operator and assign it to 'NegatedOutput'.
5. Ensure the function block ends correctly.

This structured text code will effectively create a NOT gate that outputs the negation of the boolean input.
