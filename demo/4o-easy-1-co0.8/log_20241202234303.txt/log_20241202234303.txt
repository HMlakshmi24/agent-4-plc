# A PLC function block needs to be designed called 'constantprogram' using structured text (ST) code. This function block will take an integer input and return two integer outputs. The first output 'o' should be the same as the input value, and the second output 'c' should always be a constant value of 43. The function block should not include any additional main program or testing content.

<code>
# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in structured text (ST) programming language.

1. Start by defining the function block named 'constantprogram'.
2. Declare the input variable 'i' of type integer (INT).
3. Declare the output variables 'o' and 'c' of type integer (INT).
4. In the body of the function block, assign the input value 'i' to the output 'o'.
5. Set the output 'c' to the constant value of 43.
6. End the function block with 'END_FUNCTION_BLOCK'.

Here's the structured text (ST) code for the function block:

FUNCTION_BLOCK constantprogram
VAR_INPUT
    i : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    o : INT;
    c : INT;
END_VAR
VAR
END_VAR

o := i;
c := 43;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>

# Planning to solve this problem.

1. Define the function block with the appropriate name and structure.
2. Declare the necessary input and output variables with correct data types.
3. Implement the logic to assign the input to the first output and set the second output to a constant value.
4. Ensure the function block is correctly terminated without any additional testing or main program code.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

The problem of creating a PLC function block like 'constantprogram' is not about using a specific computational algorithm but about understanding how to implement a simple logic in a structured text programming environment. 

Tutorial:
1. **Understanding PLC and Structured Text (ST)**: 
   - PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) are industrial computers used for automation of electromechanical processes. They use programming languages like Ladder Logic, Structured Text (ST), etc.
   - Structured Text (ST) is a high-level, block-structured programming language similar to Pascal or C, used in PLCs.

2. **Defining a Function Block**:
   - Function blocks in ST are reusable code units that can process inputs to produce outputs. They are similar to functions or methods in other programming languages.
   - Begin by declaring the function block using the `FUNCTION_BLOCK` keyword followed by the block name.

3. **Variable Declaration**:
   - Use `VAR_INPUT` and `VAR_OUTPUT` to declare input and output variables respectively. 
   - Define the data type for each variable. Common types include `BOOL`, `INT`, `REAL`, etc.

4. **Implementing Logic**:
   - Implement the logic within the function block. This involves assigning values to outputs based on inputs or other conditions.
   - Use standard operators and syntax to perform assignments and operations.

5. **Ending the Function Block**:
   - Conclude with `END_FUNCTION_BLOCK` to mark the end of the function block.

This approach is fundamental in building function blocks for automation tasks that require specific input-output relationships, often used in industrial control systems. The focus is on understanding and implementing the logic rather than complex algorithms.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The problem of creating a PLC function block like 'constantprogram' is not about using a specific computational algorithm but about understanding how to implement a simple logic in a structured text programming environment.

## Problem to be solved:
A PLC function block needs to be designed called 'constantprogram' using structured text (ST) code. This function block will take an integer input and return two integer outputs. The first output 'o' should be the same as the input value, and the second output 'c' should always be a constant value of 43. The function block should not include any additional main program or testing content.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: i = 10
- Output: o = 10, c = 43

- Input: i = 25
- Output: o = 25, c = 43

- Input: i = -5
- Output: o = -5, c = 43

# Planning:
1. Define the function block named 'constantprogram' using the `FUNCTION_BLOCK` keyword.
2. Declare the input variable 'i' of type integer (INT) within the `VAR_INPUT` section.
3. Declare the output variables 'o' and 'c' of type integer (INT) within the `VAR_OUTPUT` section.
4. Implement the logic inside the function block:
   - Assign the input value 'i' to the output 'o'.
   - Set the output 'c' to the constant value of 43.
5. End the function block with `END_FUNCTION_BLOCK` to ensure proper structure and termination.
6. Make sure the code does not include any additional main program or testing content.
