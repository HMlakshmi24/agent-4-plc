# Implement a PLC program using structured text (ST code) for a loop counter function block. The function block should increment a macro variable on each call, controlling the decrement cycle with a micro variable. The block should return the current counter value through an output variable and reset the micro variable to the macro value when it reaches zero. The macro and micro variables must be managed to remain positive, ensuring the output value is always positive.

# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Define the function block `FB_LoopCounter` with appropriate input, internal, and output variables.
2. Use an input variable `i` to trigger the counter increment process.
3. Decrease the `micro` variable by 1 on each call.
4. Check if `micro` reaches zero. If so, increment the `macro` variable by 1 and reset `micro` to the new value of `macro`.
5. Assign the current `macro` value to the output variable `o`.
6. Ensure that `macro` and `micro` do not go negative and that `o` always remains a positive integer.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
# For this problem, a simple control flow algorithm is used in the form of a loop and conditional checks. The structured text provides a way to sequentially check and update values, similar to a basic iterative process. 
# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

<!-- Tutorial -->
To solve problems like this using control flow in programming, follow these general steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements**: Begin with a clear understanding of the problem requirements and constraints. Identify the input, process, and output.

2. **Define Variables**: Clearly define the necessary variables. For control systems, this usually includes input, output, and internal state variables.

3. **Control Logic**: Use control structures such as loops and conditionals to implement the logic. For counters, this often involves incrementing or decrementing a variable based on certain conditions.

4. **State Management**: Carefully manage the state of variables to ensure they meet all constraints. Avoid negative values unless specifically required, and consider edge cases.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Once the logic is implemented, test the program with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected. Validate that all conditions are handled correctly.

By following these guidelines, you can implement effective control systems in structured text or similar programming languages.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Control Flow Algorithm

## Problem to be solved: 
Implement a PLC program using structured text (ST code) for a loop counter function block. The function block should increment a macro variable on each call, controlling the decrement cycle with a micro variable. The block should return the current counter value through an output variable and reset the micro variable to the macro value when it reaches zero. The macro and micro variables must be managed to remain positive, ensuring the output value is always positive.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
Sample Input: 
- Trigger input `i` set to TRUE.

Sample Output: 
- The output variable `o` will show incremented values of `macro` as the function is triggered repeatedly.

## Planning:
1. Define the function block `FB_LoopCounter` with appropriate input, internal, and output variables.
2. Use an input variable `i` to trigger the counter increment process.
3. Decrease the `micro` variable by 1 on each call.
4. Check if `micro` reaches zero. If so, increment the `macro` variable by 1 and reset `micro` to the new value of `macro`.
5. Assign the current `macro` value to the output variable `o`.
6. Ensure that `macro` and `micro` do not go negative and that `o` always remains a positive integer.
