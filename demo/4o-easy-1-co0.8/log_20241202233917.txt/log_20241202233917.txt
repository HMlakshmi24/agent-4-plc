# Design a function block (FB) in Structured Text (ST) for a PLC program that involves two nested loops. The outer loop (i) iterates from 0 to 10, and the inner loop (j) iterates from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. During each iteration, if the flag is TRUE, the loop exits, and the count is updated to keep track of how many times the inner loop executed. Ensure that the count does not exceed the expected maximum of iterations and that loop variables stay within their defined bounds.

# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Structured Text (ST).

1. Define the function block with necessary variables.
2. Implement the outer loop iterating variable i from 0 to 10.
3. Within the outer loop, implement the inner loop iterating variable j from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2.
4. Check the condition if the flag is TRUE inside the inner loop. If TRUE, exit the loop.
5. Update the count to track how many times the inner loop executed if flag is FALSE.
6. Ensure count does not exceed the maximum number of iterations.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Iterative) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

To solve the original problem of implementing nested loops with conditional exit and count tracking, we primarily use an Iterative approach. This involves systematically going through each element or value in a range, one at a time, to perform operations.

## Iterative Algorithm Tutorial

### What is Iterative Algorithm?
An iterative algorithm repeats a specific block of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met. It is characterized by the use of loops (such as for, while, do-while loops in various programming languages).

### Steps to Implement Iterative Algorithm:
1. **Initialization**: Set up variables needed for iteration (e.g., loop counters, flags).
2. **Loop Structure**: Decide on the type of loop that fits the problem (e.g., for loop for a known number of iterations, while loop for an unknown number of iterations).
3. **Condition Checking**: Within the loop, check conditions to determine if the loop should continue or break.
4. **Operations**: Perform the desired operations during each iteration.
5. **Termination**: Ensure that the loop will eventually terminate by updating loop variables correctly and checking conditions.
6. **Post-Loop Operations**: After exiting the loop, handle any operations that depend on the loop's execution.

### Use Cases:
- When you need to traverse a collection (e.g., arrays, lists).
- When performing repeated calculations until a condition is met.
- In scenarios where the exact number of iterations is predetermined or calculated during runtime.

### Examples:
- Summation of numbers from 1 to N.
- Iterating through a list to find a particular item.
- Implementing a countdown timer.

By following these steps, one can effectively utilize iterative algorithms to solve problems involving repeated actions or processes within programming tasks.

problem:
Iterative Algorithm

## Problem to be solved:
Design a function block (FB) in Structured Text (ST) for a PLC program that involves two nested loops. The outer loop (i) iterates from 0 to 10, and the inner loop (j) iterates from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. During each iteration, if the flag is TRUE, the loop exits, and the count is updated to keep track of how many times the inner loop executed. Ensure that the count does not exceed the expected maximum of iterations and that loop variables stay within their defined bounds.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: {No specific input, operates based on defined loops and flag}
- Output: {Count of inner loop iterations before exit based on flag condition}

## Planning:
1. Define the function block with appropriate variable declarations.
2. Implement the outer loop that iterates over a fixed range from 0 to 10.
3. Nest the inner loop within the outer loop with a range from 10 to 100 and a step size of 2.
4. Include a conditional exit strategy for the inner loop based on a boolean flag.
5. Increment a count variable to keep track of the number of iterations of the inner loop.
6. Ensure that all loop variables and count are properly managed and stay within their bounds.
7. Validate that the count does not exceed the maximum number of iterations expected.
