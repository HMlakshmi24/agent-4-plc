<description>
The problem is to design a PLC function block named `LED_Control` using structured text (ST) code. The function block should have two Boolean input variables (`PB1` and `PB2`) and one Boolean output variable (`LED`). The logic required is to perform a logical AND operation between `PB1` and the negation of `PB2` to determine the state of `LED`.

VAR_INPUT
    PB1 : BOOL;

END_VAR

(* Logical operation to determine the state of LED *)
LED := PB1 AND NOT PB2;

<algorithm>
The algorithm used in the original problem is a simple logic gate operation (Boolean algebra) which is a fundamental aspect of control systems in PLC programming. 

Tutorial:
1. **Overview**: Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions and are the fundamental building blocks of digital integrated circuits. In PLCs, Boolean logic is used to control outputs based on various input conditions.

2. **Basic Logic Gates**: 
   - **AND Gate**: Outputs true only if all inputs are true.
   - **OR Gate**: Outputs true if at least one input is true.
   - **NOT Gate**: Inverts the input signal.

3. **Combining Logic Gates**: 
   - More complex expressions can be created by combining the basic gates. For example, `A AND NOT B` means the output is true only when `A` is true and `B` is false.

4. **Implementation in ST**: 
   - ST (Structured Text) is a high-level language used in PLCs which allows you to write logic using familiar programming syntax. 
   - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to create the desired logic function.

5. **Practical Applications**: 
   - Used in various control systems where decisions need to be made based on multiple input conditions. Examples include motor starters, valve actuators, and light controllers.

By understanding how to implement these operations in a function block, you'll be able to design control systems that respond to a variety of input conditions with the correct outputs.
