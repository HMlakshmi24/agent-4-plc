<description>
Create a function block in Structured Text (ST) for a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) to toggle a boolean output each time a button is pressed. The function should detect the transition of the button from not pressed (FALSE) to pressed (TRUE) and toggle the output accordingly.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK TOGGLE_OUTPUT
VAR_INPUT
    Button : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    ToggledOutput : BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR
VAR
    PrevButtonState : BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

// Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Structured Text (ST) programming language.
IF Button AND NOT PrevButtonState THEN
    ToggledOutput := NOT ToggledOutput; // Toggle the output when button transition is detected
END_IF;
PrevButtonState := Button; // Update previous button state for next cycle

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the function block `TOGGLE_OUTPUT` with one input `Button` and one output `ToggledOutput`.
2. Introduce a local variable `PrevButtonState` to keep track of the button's previous state.
3. Within the function block, check if the button has transitioned from not pressed to pressed.
4. If the transition is detected, toggle the `ToggledOutput`.
5. Update `PrevButtonState` with the current button state for use in the next cycle.
6. This logic ensures that the output is toggled only once for each button press.

<algorithm>
# To solve the original problem, the algorithm primarily used is a state transition detection algorithm.
# 
# Tutorial:
# 
# 1. **State Transition Detection**:
#    - This algorithm focuses on detecting changes in state rather than the state itself. For a button input, it detects when the button changes from a non-pressed to a pressed state.
#    - The detection is typically done by comparing the current state of the input with the previous state.
#    - When the desired transition (e.g., FALSE to TRUE) is detected, a specified action is performed, such as toggling an output.
# 
# 2. **Implementation Steps**:
#    - **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing necessary variables, including those for tracking the current and previous states.
#    - **Detect Transition**: In each cycle, compare the current input state to the previous state to detect a transition.
#    - **Perform Action**: If the transition is detected, execute the required action (e.g., toggle a boolean output).
#    - **Update State**: After processing, update the previous state to the current state for the next cycle.
# 
# 3. **Applications**:
#    - This algorithm is widely used in embedded systems and PLCs where inputs need to be debounced or state changes need to be captured for triggering events.
#    - It's useful in scenarios like button press detection, edge detection, and toggle mechanisms.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next 
problem:
To solve the original problem, the algorithm primarily used is a state transition detection algorithm.

1. **State Transition Detection**:
   - This algorithm focuses on detecting changes in state rather than the state itself. For a button input, it detects when the button changes from a non-pressed to a pressed state.
   - The detection is typically done by comparing the current state of the input with the previous state.
   - When the desired transition (e.g., FALSE to TRUE) is detected, a specified action is performed, such as toggling an output.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing necessary variables, including those for tracking the current and previous states.
   - **Detect Transition**: In each cycle, compare the current input state to the previous state to detect a transition.
   - **Perform Action**: If the transition is detected, execute the required action (e.g., toggle a boolean output).
   - **Update State**: After processing, update the previous state to the current state for the next cycle.

3. **Applications**:
   - This algorithm is widely used in embedded systems and PLCs where inputs need to be debounced or state changes need to be captured for triggering events.
   - It's useful in scenarios like button press detection, edge detection, and toggle mechanisms.

## Problem to be solved: 
Create a function block in Structured Text (ST) for a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) to toggle a boolean output each time a button is pressed. The function should detect the transition of the button from not pressed (FALSE) to pressed (TRUE) and toggle the output accordingly.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: Button = TRUE (pressed), Button = FALSE (not pressed)
- Output: ToggledOutput = TRUE (after odd number of presses), ToggledOutput = FALSE (after even number of presses)

## Planning:
1. Define the function block `TOGGLE_OUTPUT` with one input `Button` and one output `ToggledOutput`.
2. Introduce a local variable `PrevButtonState` to keep track of the button's previous state.
3. Within the function block, check if the button has transitioned from not pressed to pressed.
4. If the transition is detected, toggle the `ToggledOutput`.
5. Update `PrevButtonState` with the current button state for use in the next cycle.
6. This logic ensures that the output is toggled only once for each button press.
