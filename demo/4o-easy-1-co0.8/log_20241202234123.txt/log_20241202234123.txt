# The problem requires designing a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST code) to process multiple emergency stop signals. The function block must accept several emergency stop input signals and generate corresponding output signals by logically inverting each input. Each output should indicate the logical NOT of its respective input, reflecting the emergency stop activation status.

# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Define a function block named "FB_Estop_Processor".
2. Declare input variables for each emergency stop signal (e.g., Field_Estop_IN, R1_Estop_IN, etc.) as BOOL data types.
3. Declare output variables for each emergency stop output signal (e.g., Field_Estop_OUT, R1_Estop_OUT, etc.) as BOOL data types.
4. For each input signal, use the NOT operator to logically invert the signal and assign it to the corresponding output variable.
5. Ensure the function block performs these operations correctly to reflect the emergency stop activation status.

# The algorithm used to solve the original problem is a simple application of Boolean logic with the NOT operation.
# Tutorial: Boolean Logic and NOT Operation
Boolean logic is a subset of algebra used for creating expressions and statements that can be either true or false. In the context of programming and digital electronics, Boolean logic is essential for decision-making and control flow.

In this specific problem, the NOT operation is used. The NOT operation is a unary operation (meaning it operates on a single operand) that inverts the value of a Boolean expression. If the expression is true, NOT makes it false, and if it's false, NOT makes it true.

For example, if you have a Boolean variable `X` which is true, then `NOT X` evaluates to false, and vice versa.

Steps to apply the NOT operation in a control system:
1. Identify the Boolean variables that need to be inverted.
2. Apply the NOT operation to each variable to get the desired logical inversion.
3. Use the results of the NOT operation in further logical expressions or output evaluations to control systems or processes appropriately.

In structured text or any programming environment that supports Boolean operations, the NOT keyword is typically used to denote logical inversion.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Boolean Logic and NOT Operation

## Problem to be solved: 
Design a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST code) to process multiple emergency stop signals. The function block must accept several emergency stop input signals and generate corresponding output signals by logically inverting each input. Each output should indicate the logical NOT of its respective input, reflecting the emergency stop activation status.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: Field_Estop_IN = TRUE, R1_Estop_IN = FALSE, R2_Estop_IN = TRUE
- Output: Field_Estop_OUT = FALSE, R1_Estop_OUT = TRUE, R2_Estop_OUT = FALSE

## Planning:
1. Define a function block named "FB_Estop_Processor".
2. Declare input variables for each emergency stop signal (e.g., Field_Estop_IN, R1_Estop_IN, etc.) as BOOL data types.
3. Declare output variables for each emergency stop output signal (e.g., Field_Estop_OUT, R1_Estop_OUT, etc.) as BOOL data types.
4. For each input signal, use the NOT operator to logically invert the signal and assign it to the corresponding output variable.
5. Ensure the function block performs these operations correctly to reflect the emergency stop activation status.
