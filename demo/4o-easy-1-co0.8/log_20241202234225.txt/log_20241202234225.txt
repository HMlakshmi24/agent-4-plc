<description>
Design a PLC function block using structured text (ST code) to manage and increment two variables, aaa and bbb, based on their comparative values. The function block should utilize the following logic:
- If aaa is equal to bbb, increment aaa by 1.
- If aaa is greater than bbb, increment bbb by 1.
- If aaa is less than bbb, increment aaa by 1.
The output variable, OUT, should represent the difference between aaa and bbb after executing the increments.
Additionally, a cycle counter, CYCLE, should increment with each function block execution to track the processing cycles.

        aaa : DINT := 1;
        bbb : DINT := 0;
    END_VAR

        OUT : DINT;
        UPDATED_CYCLE : DINT;
    END_VAR

        CYCLE : DINT := 0;
    END_VAR

    // Increment the variables based on the conditions
    IF aaa = bbb THEN
        aaa := aaa + 1;
    ELSIF aaa > bbb THEN
        bbb := bbb + 1;
    ELSE
        aaa := aaa + 1;
    END_IF;

    // Calculate the output difference
    OUT := aaa - bbb;

    // Increment the cycle counter
    CYCLE := CYCLE + 1;
    UPDATED_CYCLE := CYCLE;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the function block `FB_ValueTracker`.
2. Declare input variables `aaa` and `bbb` with their initial values.
3. Declare output variables `OUT` and `UPDATED_CYCLE` to store the result and cycle count.
4. Inside the function block, use conditional statements to compare `aaa` and `bbb`.
5. Based on the comparison, increment the appropriate variable (`aaa` or `bbb`).
6. Calculate the difference between `aaa` and `bbb` and assign it to `OUT`.
7. Increment the cycle counter `CYCLE` and assign its value to `UPDATED_CYCLE`.
8. Ensure no additional main program or test code is included, only the function block.

<description>
Create a PLC function block using structured text (ST) to manage two variables, x and y. The block should perform the following:
- If x is less than y, set x to y.
- If x is greater than or equal to y, set y to x.
Additionally, maintain a counter that increments with each execution of the function block.

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve the original problem is a simple conditional logic approach. This involves using conditional statements to evaluate the relationship between two variables and then performing specific actions based on these conditions.

Here's a high-level tutorial for solving these types of problems using conditional logic:

1. **Define Problem Requirements**: Clearly outline the conditions and actions that need to be implemented in the function block or program.

2. **Identify Variables**: Determine the input and output variables required for the logic. Identify any internal variables needed for processing.

3. **Implement Conditional Statements**: Use 'IF', 'ELSE IF', and 'ELSE' statements to check the conditions. Each condition should lead to a specific action based on the requirement.

4. **Perform Required Actions**: According to the evaluated condition, perform the necessary operations such as incrementing a variable or updating a counter.

5. **Update Outputs**: After executing the necessary actions, update the output variables with the results of these operations.

6. **Cycle Counting**: If required, implement a counter to track the number of executions or cycles of the logic block.

7. **Testing and Validation**: Ensure the function block is tested for different scenarios to validate that all conditions and actions are correctly implemented.

By following these steps, you can implement a conditional logic-based solution that meets the specified requirements.

## Problem to be solved: 
Create a PLC function block using structured text (ST) to manage two variables, x and y. The block should perform the following:
- If x is less than y, set x to y.
- If x is greater than or equal to y, set y to x.
Additionally, maintain a counter that increments with each execution of the function block.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: x = 5, y = 3
- Operations: Since x > y, set y to x
- Output: Counter = 1, x = 5, y = 5

- Input: x = 2, y = 4
- Operations: Since x < y, set x to y
- Output: Counter = 2, x = 4, y = 4

## Planning:
1. Define the function block `FB_CompareAndSet`.
2. Declare input variables `x` and `y`.
3. Declare an output variable `Counter` to track the number of executions.
4. Use conditional statements to compare `x` and `y`.
5. Set `x` to `y` if `x` is less than `y`, otherwise set `y` to `x`.
6. Increment the counter `InternalCounter` on each execution and assign its value to `Counter`.
