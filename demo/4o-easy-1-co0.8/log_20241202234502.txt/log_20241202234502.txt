# Design a PLC program using Structured Text (ST) to create a functional block named FB_SequentialAssignment. The block should have an integer input, which is assigned sequentially to variables a, b, c, and d0. Finally, the value of d0 should be assigned to an output variable o. The program should also include a main program, MAIN, where the subroutine constantprogram is called with an integer value of 3.

2. Declare input variable 'i' as an integer.
3. Declare intermediate variables 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd0' as integers.
4. Declare output variable 'o' as an integer.
5. Implement the logic to assign the input value 'i' to 'a', then assign 'a' to 'b', then 'b' to 'c', then 'c' to 'd0', and finally 'd0' to the output 'o'.
6. In the main program MAIN, create an instance of FB_SequentialAssignment.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
# This problem uses a Sequential Assignment approach, which is essentially a straightforward series of assignments from one variable to another. It doesn't require a complex algorithm like those mentioned (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, etc.), but rather a simple procedural execution.

# Tutorial on Sequential Assignment:
1. **Sequential Assignment Basics**: In programming, sequential assignment is a simple method where you assign values from one variable to the next in a sequential manner. This is often used in initialization or transformation of data within a program.

2. **Structured Text (ST) in PLCs**: ST is a high-level programming language used for PLC programming. It's similar to Pascal and is designed for complex control algorithms and data handling. Understanding ST's syntax is crucial for implementing sequential assignment in this context.

3. **Function Blocks**: In ST, function blocks are used to encapsulate a set of operations or data transformations. By defining input, output, and internal variables, you can create reusable components that perform specific tasks.

4. **Implementation of Sequential Assignment**: 
   - Define the structure of your function block with input, internal, and output variables.
   - Implement the logic that performs the sequential assignment of values from one variable to the next.
   - Use a main program to instantiate and execute the function block, passing appropriate input values.

5. **Testing and Validation**: After implementing the function block and main program, test the program to ensure that the sequential assignment works as expected. Validate the output against the expected results to ensure reliability and correctness of the program.

This approach is straightforward and does not require optimization as it is simply a sequence of assignments. It is important to ensure that data types are consistent and that the logic flow from input to output is correct.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Sequential Assignment

## Problem to be solved: 
Design a PLC program using Structured Text (ST) to create a functional block named FB_SequentialAssignment. The block should have an integer input, which is assigned sequentially to variables a, b, c, and d0. Finally, the value of d0 should be assigned to an output variable o. The program should also include a main program, MAIN, where the subroutine constantprogram is called with an integer value of 3.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
### Input:
- Integer value: 3

### Output:
- Output variable o: 3

## Planning:
1. Define a function block named FB_SequentialAssignment.
2. Declare input variable 'i' as an integer.
3. Declare intermediate variables 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd0' as integers.
4. Declare output variable 'o' as an integer.
5. Implement the logic to assign the input value 'i' to 'a', then assign 'a' to 'b', then 'b' to 'c', then 'c' to 'd0', and finally 'd0' to the output 'o'.
6. In the main program MAIN, create an instance of FB_SequentialAssignment.
7. Call the instance with an input value of 3, which will execute the sequential assignment logic.
