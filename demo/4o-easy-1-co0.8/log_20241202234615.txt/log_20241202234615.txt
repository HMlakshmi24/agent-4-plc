# The problem is to create a function block in Structured Text (ST) that takes two integer inputs and outputs the larger of the two integers. The function block should ensure that the output accurately reflects the maximum of the two inputs within a single PLC cycle.
</description>
<code>
# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Structured Text (ST) programming language.

1. Define the function block named FIND_MAX_VALUE.
2. Declare two input variables, Value1 and Value2, of type INT.
3. Declare an output variable, MaxValue, of type INT.
4. Implement the logic to compare Value1 and Value2.
5. Assign the larger value to the output variable MaxValue.
6. End the function block.

Here is the ST code:

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK FIND_MAX_VALUE
VAR_INPUT
    Value1 : INT;
    Value2 : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    MaxValue : INT;
END_VAR

IF Value1 > Value2 THEN
    MaxValue := Value1;
ELSE
    MaxValue := Value2;
END_IF;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

# The algorithm that needs to be used to solve the original problem is a simple conditional (comparison) algorithm.

# Tutorial: Comparison Algorithm
A comparison algorithm is used to determine the relationship between two values. In the context of finding the maximum of two numbers, the algorithm compares the values and selects the larger one. This is done using conditional statements such as IF-THEN-ELSE.

1. **Define the Problem**: Determine the larger of two given values.
2. **Input**: Two values that need to be compared.
3. **Comparison**: Use a conditional statement to compare the two values.
   - IF the first value is greater than the second, THEN the first value is the maximum.
   - ELSE the second value is the maximum.
4. **Output**: Assign the maximum value to the output variable.
5. **Cycle Time**: Ensure that the comparison and assignment are done within one cycle to maintain efficiency in real-time systems like PLCs.

This type of algorithm is straightforward but crucial in many control systems where decisions are made based on comparing different sensor inputs or calculated values.
