# Design a Function Block in Structured Text (ST) named `dw`, which takes an integer input `i` and returns an integer output `o`. The function block includes an internal integer variable `ss` that increments by 1 each time the block is executed. If the input `i` is equal to 1, the output `o` should be set to 1. Otherwise, `o` should be set to the current value of `ss`. Design a main program (MAIN) that calls this function block with the input value 3. Ensure the logic of input processing, internal state management (`ss`), and output assignment is correctly implemented.

# Planning to solve this problem.
1. Define a Function Block named `dw` with input, output, and an internal variable.
2. Initialize the internal variable `ss` to 0.
3. Increment the internal variable `ss` by 1 each time the block is executed.
4. Check the input `i`: if it's equal to 1, set the output `o` to 1; otherwise, assign the current value of `ss` to `o`.
5. Design a MAIN program to create an instance of the Function Block and call it with a specified input, capturing the output.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
The algorithm used in this problem is a simple state management algorithm where the internal state `ss` is used to track the number of executions. This is a straightforward conditional and state update mechanism, often found in control systems and real-time applications.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this type of problem. Do not generate code.

In control systems and real-time applications, maintaining and updating the internal state is crucial for correct functionality and performance. Here's a high-level tutorial on state management:

1. **Understanding State Management**: State management involves tracking and updating the internal state of an application or a function block to ensure the correct operation based on the history of inputs and executions.

2. **Defining Internal Variables**: Identify the variables that need to retain their values between executions. These are typically initialized once and updated during each execution cycle.

3. **Handling Inputs and Outputs**: Determine how the inputs affect the internal state and how the outputs are derived from both the inputs and the internal state.

4. **Implementing Update Logic**: Implement logic to update the internal state based on inputs. This may involve conditional statements to alter the flow based on specific criteria.

5. **Testing and Verification**: Ensure thorough testing of the state management logic to confirm that internal states are updated correctly and outputs are as expected.

6. **Optimization**: In real-time applications, optimizing the state management logic for performance is crucial. This might involve minimizing the number of state updates and ensuring efficient conditional checks.

By following these steps, one can effectively manage the internal state of an application, ensuring it behaves correctly over successive executions. This concept is central to many applications in embedded systems, automation, and control engineering.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next 
problem:
The algorithm used in this problem is a simple state management algorithm where the internal state `ss` is used to track the number of executions. This is a straightforward conditional and state update mechanism, often found in control systems and real-time applications.

## Problem to be solved: 
Design a Function Block in Structured Text (ST) named `dw`, which takes an integer input `i` and returns an integer output `o`. The function block includes an internal integer variable `ss` that increments by 1 each time the block is executed. If the input `i` is equal to 1, the output `o` should be set to 1. Otherwise, `o` should be set to the current value of `ss`. Design a main program (MAIN) that calls this function block with the input value 3. Ensure the logic of input processing, internal state management (`ss`), and output assignment is correctly implemented.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
Sample Input: `i = 3`  
Sample Output: `o = value of ss after execution`

# Planning: 
1. Define a Function Block named `dw` with input `i`, output `o`, and an internal variable `ss`.
2. Initialize the internal variable `ss` to 0.
3. Increment the internal variable `ss` by 1 each time the block is executed.
4. Implement a conditional check for the input `i`: 
   - If `i` is equal to 1, set the output `o` to 1. 
   - Otherwise, assign the current value of `ss` to `o`.
5. Design a MAIN program to:
   - Create an instance of the Function Block `dw`.
   - Call the instance with a specified input value of 3.
   - Capture and store the output in a variable `output_o`.
