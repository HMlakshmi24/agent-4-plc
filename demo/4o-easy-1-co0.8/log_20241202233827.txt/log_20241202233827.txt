# Tutorial: Conditional Logic and Decision Making in PLCs
# Conditional logic is a fundamental concept in programming that allows the execution of certain pieces of code based on specific conditions. In the context of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), structured text (ST) is often used to implement such logic in a clear and organized manner.

# The key components of conditional logic in ST include:
# 1. IF-THEN-ELSE Statements: These are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The basic structure is:
#    IF (condition) THEN
#       // Code to execute if condition is true
#    ELSIF (another condition) THEN
#       // Code to execute if another condition is true
#    ELSE
#       // Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
#    END_IF;
# 2. Logical Operators: These are used to combine multiple conditions, such as AND, OR, and NOT. They help in creating complex conditions that can control the flow of the program.
# 3. Comparison Operators: These are used to compare values, such as =, <>, >, <, >=, and <=. Comparisons are often used in conditions to determine which branch of code to execute.

# When designing PLC programs using conditional logic, it is important to:
# - Clearly define the conditions that will be checked.
# - Ensure all possible conditions are accounted for to prevent undefined behavior.
# - Optimize the conditional checks for efficiency, especially in time-critical applications.

# By mastering conditional logic in structured text, engineers can effectively control the operation of automation systems and ensure desired behaviors under various input conditions.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Conditional Logic and Decision Making in PLCs

## Problem to be solved:
Design a PLC function block named 'CALCULATE_OUTPUT' using Structured Text (ST) that calculates an output based on specific input conditions. The function block receives an integer input 'i' and produces an output 'o' based on the following rules:
- If the input 'i' is 0, the output 'o' is 0.
- If the input 'i' is between 1 and 5, the output 'o' is the square of 'i'.
- If the input 'i' is between 6 and 10, the output 'o' is equal to 'i' plus two times 'i'.
- Otherwise, the output 'o' is assigned a value of -1.
The program should ensure valid bounds for 'i' and that 'o' never takes undefined or invalid values.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: i = 0; Output: o = 0
- Input: i = 3; Output: o = 9
- Input: i = 7; Output: o = 21
- Input: i = 11; Output: o = -1

## Planning:
1. Define a new FUNCTION_BLOCK named FB_CalculateOutput.
2. Declare the input variable 'i' of type INT.
3. Declare the output variable 'o' of type INT.
4. Implement conditional logic using IF, ELSIF, and ELSE statements to determine the output 'o' based on the input 'i':
   a. If 'i' is 0, set 'o' to 0.
   b. If 'i' is between 1 and 5, set 'o' to the square of 'i'.
   c. If 'i' is between 6 and 10, calculate 'o' as 'i' plus two times 'i'.
   d. For any other value of 'i', set 'o' to -1.
5. Ensure that the function block handles all specified conditions and edge cases for the input 'i'.
