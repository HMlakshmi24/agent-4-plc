# The algorithm that needs to be used to solve the original problem is a simple logical operation algorithm.
# 
# Tutorial for Logical Operations in PLCs:
#
# Logical operations are fundamental to PLC programming and are used to make decisions based on input conditions. The basic logical operations include AND, OR, and NOT. 
#
# - AND operation: It evaluates to TRUE only if all operands are TRUE. In PLCs, this is used to check if multiple conditions are met simultaneously.
#
# - OR operation: It evaluates to TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE. This is useful for checking if at least one condition is satisfied.
#
# - NOT operation: This is a unary operation that inverts the value of a boolean input. It is used to negate a condition.
#
# In Structured Text (ST), these operations are implemented using reserved keywords: AND, OR, and NOT. They are used to manipulate boolean variables and can be combined to form more complex logical expressions.
#
# To create a function block for these operations:
# 1. Define the function block with a descriptive name.
# 2. Declare the necessary input and output variables.
# 3. Implement the logic using the appropriate logical operators.
# 4. Follow the syntax rules of Structured Text to ensure the function block is correctly defined.
#
# Logical operations in PLCs are crucial for control systems where decisions need to be made based on varying conditions.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Logical operations in PLCs are fundamental for decision-making processes. They include basic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT. These operations help evaluate conditions and are implemented using reserved keywords in Structured Text. The steps to create a function block for logical operations include defining the block, declaring input/output variables, implementing the logic, and ensuring correct syntax.

## Problem to be solved: 
Create a PLC function block named NOT_GATE in Structured Text (ST) that implements a simple boolean NOT gate. The function block should have one boolean input named 'Input' and one boolean output named 'NotResult'. The output should be TRUE when the input is FALSE, and FALSE when the input is TRUE.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: FALSE, Output: TRUE
- Input: TRUE, Output: FALSE

## Planning:
1. Define a function block named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare one boolean input 'Input'.
3. Declare one boolean output 'NotResult'.
4. Implement the logic: Set 'NotResult' to TRUE if 'Input' is FALSE, and set it to FALSE if 'Input' is TRUE.
5. Ensure the syntax follows Structured Text standards.
