<description>
The problem requires creating a structured text (ST) code for a function block (FB) in a PLC program to monitor start/stop signals and manage trigger and rising edge signals. The function block should detect when the 'Start_Stop' input signal changes from 'FALSE' to 'TRUE' (rising edge), set 'ONS_Trig' to 'TRUE' during this change, update 'ON_OFF' based on the XOR of 'ONS_Trig' and 'ON_OFF', and store the current value of 'Start_Stop' in 'Rising_ONS' for the next cycle.

<planning>
1. Define the input and output variables for the function block - 'Start_Stop', 'ONS_Trig', 'Rising_ONS', and 'ON_OFF'.
2. Use an internal variable 'Prev_Start_Stop' to keep track of the previous state of 'Start_Stop'.
3. Implement logic to set 'ONS_Trig' to 'TRUE' when there is a rising edge (transition from 'FALSE' to 'TRUE') in 'Start_Stop'.
4. Use the XOR operation to update 'ON_OFF' based on 'ONS_Trig' and the current state of 'ON_OFF'.
5. Update 'Rising_ONS' and 'Prev_Start_Stop' with the current state of 'Start_Stop' for use in the next cycle.

<algorithm>
The algorithm employed in this problem is a combination of edge detection and boolean logic. Specifically, it uses the concept of a rising edge detector, which is a simple form of an event-driven algorithm. The rising edge detection identifies when a boolean signal transitions from FALSE to TRUE, which is critical in many control systems for detecting changes in state. The XOR logic is used to toggle a state based on specific conditions, which is a common logic operation in digital systems for managing state changes. 

Tutorial:
1. **Rising Edge Detection**: This is a fundamental concept in digital signal processing where the focus is on identifying the transition of a signal from a low state (FALSE) to a high state (TRUE). It is often implemented using a combination of the current and previous state of a signal. In structured text, this can be done using simple boolean operations.

2. **XOR Logic**: XOR, or exclusive OR, is a logical operation that outputs true or 1 only when the inputs differ. In PLCs, XOR is used to toggle outputs or to implement other logical operations that require alternating states. In structured text, the XOR operation can be directly used to achieve this toggling effect.

3. **State Management in PLCs**: This involves keeping track of the current and previous states of a system to determine transitions and make appropriate decisions. In structured text, state variables (like 'Prev_Start_Stop') are used to store these states across program cycles.

By combining these concepts, we can efficiently implement control logic that responds to signal changes and manages system states.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The algorithm employed in this problem is a combination of edge detection and boolean logic. Specifically, it uses the concept of a rising edge detector, which is a simple form of an event-driven algorithm. The rising edge detection identifies when a boolean signal transitions from FALSE to TRUE, which is critical in many control systems for detecting changes in state. The XOR logic is used to toggle a state based on specific conditions, which is a common logic operation in digital systems for managing state changes.

## Problem to be solved: 
Create a structured text (ST) code for a function block (FB) in a PLC program to monitor start/stop signals and manage trigger and rising edge signals. The function block should detect when the 'Start_Stop' input signal changes from 'FALSE' to 'TRUE' (rising edge), set 'ONS_Trig' to 'TRUE' during this change, update 'ON_OFF' based on the XOR of 'ONS_Trig' and 'ON_OFF', and store the current value of 'Start_Stop' in 'Rising_ONS' for the next cycle.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: Start_Stop signal changes from FALSE to TRUE
- Output: ONS_Trig becomes TRUE, ON_OFF is toggled based on current value, Rising_ONS is updated with current Start_Stop value

# Planning:
1. Define the input and output variables for the function block - 'Start_Stop', 'ONS_Trig', 'Rising_ONS', and 'ON_OFF'.
2. Use an internal variable 'Prev_Start_Stop' to keep track of the previous state of 'Start_Stop'.
3. Implement logic to set 'ONS_Trig' to 'TRUE' when there is a rising edge (transition from 'FALSE' to 'TRUE') in 'Start_Stop'.
4. Use the XOR operation to update 'ON_OFF' based on 'ONS_Trig' and the current state of 'ON_OFF'.
5. Update 'Rising_ONS' and 'Prev_Start_Stop' with the current state of 'Start_Stop' for use in the next cycle.
