<description>
A problem similar to the one described involves creating a PLC function block to monitor the performance metrics of a network node. The task is to design a function block that tracks the packet loss rate and updates minimum and maximum packet size values based on input conditions. The function block has input variables for packet size and node status, and IN_OUT variables for packet loss count, total packet loss count, minimum packet size, and maximum packet size.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK PacketMonitor
VAR_INPUT
packet_size : DINT;            // Input packet size in bytes
NODE_STATUS : UDINT;           // Input node status
END_VAR

VAR_IN_OUT
packet_loss_count : DINT;      // Packet loss count for the specific node
total_packet_loss : DINT;      // Total packet loss count
min_packet_size : DINT;        // Minimum packet size observed
max_packet_size : DINT;        // Maximum packet size observed
END_VAR

IF packet_size = 0 OR NODE_STATUS <> 1 THEN
  packet_loss_count := packet_loss_count + 1;
  total_packet_loss := total_packet_loss + 1;
END_IF

IF packet_size < min_packet_size OR min_packet_size < 0 THEN
  min_packet_size := packet_size;
END_IF

IF packet_size > max_packet_size OR max_packet_size < 0 THEN
  max_packet_size := packet_size;
END_IF
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the input variables for packet size and node status.
2. Define the IN_OUT variables for packet loss count, total packet loss, minimum packet size, and maximum packet size.
3. Implement the logic to update packet loss counts when the packet size is zero or the node status is not equal to 1.
4. Implement the logic to update the minimum packet size if the new packet size is smaller than the current minimum or if the current minimum is negative.
5. Implement the logic to update the maximum packet size if the new packet size is larger than the current maximum or if the current maximum is negative.
6. Ensure the function block updates these values efficiently each time it is called.

<description>
Another relevant problem involves designing a PLC function block to track the energy consumption of a machine. The goal is to monitor the consumption rate and update minimum and maximum consumption values based on certain input conditions. The function block has input variables for consumption rate and machine status, and IN_OUT variables for consumption error count, total error count, minimum consumption, and maximum consumption.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK EnergyMonitor
VAR_INPUT
consumption_rate : REAL;       // Input energy consumption rate in kWh
MACHINE_STATUS : UDINT;        // Input machine status
END_VAR

VAR_IN_OUT
consumption_errors : DINT;     // Consumption error count for the machine
total_errors : DINT;           // Total error count
min_consumption : REAL;        // Minimum consumption observed
max_consumption : REAL;        // Maximum consumption observed
END_VAR

IF consumption_rate = 0 OR MACHINE_STATUS <> 1 THEN
  consumption_errors := consumption_errors + 1;
  total_errors := total_errors + 1;
END_IF

IF consumption_rate < min_consumption OR min_consumption < 0 THEN
  min_consumption := consumption_rate;
END_IF

IF consumption_rate > max_consumption OR max_consumption < 0 THEN
  max_consumption := consumption_rate;
END_IF
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the input variables for energy consumption rate and machine status.
2. Define the IN_OUT variables for consumption error count, total error count, minimum consumption, and maximum consumption.
3. Implement the logic to update consumption error counts when the consumption rate is zero or the machine status is not equal to 1.
4. Implement the logic to update the minimum consumption if the new consumption rate is less than the current minimum or if the current minimum is negative.
5. Implement the logic to update the maximum consumption if the new consumption rate is greater than the current maximum or if the current maximum is negative.
6. Ensure the function block updates these values efficiently each time it is called.

<algorithm>
The algorithm to solve the original problem can be classified as a combination of conditional checks and state updates. This involves:
1. **Conditional Logic**: Checking specific conditions (e.g., if latency is zero or node status is not equal to 1) to determine when to update error counts.
2. **State Management**: Maintaining and updating the state of variables (e.g., minimum and maximum latency) based on the input conditions.
3. **Iterative Updates**: The function block is called repeatedly, and with each call, it updates the relevant state variables based on the latest input data.

**Tutorial**:
When designing a function block for monitoring purposes, follow these steps:
- Define input and IN_OUT variables clearly, outlining their roles and initial values.
- Implement conditional logic to determine when to update different state variables.
- Use appropriate comparison operations to track minimum and maximum values.
- Ensure that the block efficiently updates its state each time it is called, maintaining accurate records.
- Test the function block under various scenarios to ensure it handles edge cases (e.g., initial negative values, zero inputs) correctly.

## Problem to be solved:
Design a PLC function block to monitor the latency of a network node. Update the minimum and maximum latency observed based on input conditions. The function block should include input variables for latency and node status, and IN_OUT variables for latency error count, total error count, minimum latency, and maximum latency.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
1. Input: latency = 0, NODE_STATUS = 0, min_latency = -1, max_latency = -1
   Output: latency_errors = 1, total_errors = 1, min_latency = 0, max_latency = 0

2. Input: latency = 5, NODE_STATUS = 1, min_latency = 0, max_latency = 0
   Output: latency_errors = 1, total_errors = 1, min_latency = 0, max_latency = 5

3. Input: latency = 3, NODE_STATUS = 1, min_latency = 0, max_latency = 5
   Output: latency_errors = 1, total_errors = 1, min_latency = 0, max_latency = 5

Planning:
1. Define the input variables for latency and node status.
2. Define the IN_OUT variables for latency error count, total error count, minimum latency, and maximum latency.
3. Implement the logic to update latency error counts when the latency is zero or the node status is not equal to 1.
4. Implement the logic to update the minimum latency if the new latency is less than the current minimum or if the current minimum is negative.
5. Implement the logic to update the maximum latency if the new latency is greater than the current maximum or if the current maximum is negative.
6. Ensure the function block updates these values efficiently each time it is called.
