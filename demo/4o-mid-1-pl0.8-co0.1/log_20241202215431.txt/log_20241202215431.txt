# Design and implement a function block using Structured Text (ST) to control an LED color and motor direction based on two input button signals. The function block should define input variables for button presses and output variables for controlling LED lights and motor directions. The red LED activates when the left button is pressed, and the green LED activates when the right button is pressed. The motor should run left when the left button is not pressed, and right when the right button is not pressed.

4. Implement the logic to control the LEDs:
   - Set PI_LED_Red to TRUE when E_Left and PI_Button_Left are both TRUE.
   - Set PI_LED_Green to TRUE when E_Right and PI_Button_Right are both TRUE.
5. Implement the logic to control the motor direction:
   - Set A_Motor_Left to TRUE when PI_Button_Left is FALSE.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
The problem is a straightforward control logic problem that does not require complex algorithms. It uses simple conditional logic to determine the output states of the LEDs and motor directions based on the input signals.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.
For control logic problems like this, the key is understanding the conditions under which each output should be activated or deactivated. The process involves:

1. **Identifying Inputs and Outputs**: Determine what inputs will affect the system and what outputs are needed. In this case, button presses and signals to activate LEDs and motors.

2. **Defining Conditions**: Establish the conditions that lead to each state change. For the LEDs, the condition involves checking both the button press and the signal. For the motors, it involves checking the absence of a button press.

3. **Implementing Logic**: Use basic logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to implement these conditions in the control logic. 

4. **Testing**: Once implemented, the logic should be tested with various combinations of inputs to ensure that the outputs behave as expected.

This approach is commonly used in programming function blocks for PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) in industrial automation tasks.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The problem is a straightforward control logic problem that does not require complex algorithms. It uses simple conditional logic to determine the output states of the LEDs and motor directions based on the input signals.

## Problem to be solved:
Design and implement a function block using Structured Text (ST) to control an LED color and motor direction based on two input button signals. The function block should define input variables for button presses and output variables for controlling LED lights and motor directions. The red LED activates when the left button is pressed, and the green LED activates when the right button is pressed. The motor should run left when the left button is not pressed, and right when the right button is not pressed.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
Inputs:
- PI_Button_Left: BOOL
- PI_Button_Right: BOOL
- E_Left: BOOL
- E_Right: BOOL

Outputs:
- PI_LED_Red: BOOL
- PI_LED_Green: BOOL
- A_Motor_Left: BOOL
- A_Motor_Right: BOOL

## Planning:
1. Define the function block with the name "LED_Motor_Controller".
2. Declare the input variables: PI_Button_Left, PI_Button_Right, E_Left, and E_Right, all of type BOOL.
3. Declare the output variables: PI_LED_Red, PI_LED_Green, A_Motor_Left, and A_Motor_Right, all of type BOOL.
4. Implement the logic to control the LEDs:
   - Set PI_LED_Red to TRUE when E_Left and PI_Button_Left are both TRUE.
   - Set PI_LED_Green to TRUE when E_Right and PI_Button_Right are both TRUE.
5. Implement the logic to control the motor direction:
   - Set A_Motor_Left to TRUE when PI_Button_Left is FALSE.
   - Set A_Motor_Right to TRUE when PI_Button_Right is FALSE.
6. End the function block definition.
