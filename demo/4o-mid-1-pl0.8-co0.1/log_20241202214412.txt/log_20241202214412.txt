# Design a PLC program using structured text (ST code) to manage a conveyor belt system. The system includes start and stop push buttons, a motor, and a sensor to detect objects on the conveyor. The program should start the motor when the start button is pressed and stop it when the stop button is pressed or an object is detected on the conveyor.

<algorithm>
# The algorithm that needs to be used to solve the original problem is a state monitoring and control loop with conditional logic.
# Tutorial:
1. **State Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the inputs from sensors and other devices. This is typically done in a loop that runs as long as the PLC is powered on.
2. **Conditional Logic**: Use conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE) to check the status of inputs. This determines the actions to be taken, such as adjusting outputs or setting error flags.
3. **Output Control**: Based on the conditions, control outputs like relays, motors, or actuators. This involves setting them ON or OFF or adjusting their state.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement checks to handle errors or abnormal conditions. Set error flags or codes when such conditions are detected, and ensure the system can handle these gracefully.
5. **Boolean Return**: The final step is to ensure the program can return a Boolean value indicating the successful completion of its operations or a successful status.
6. **Loop Execution**: The entire process is typically enclosed in a loop, repeating continuously to ensure real-time control and monitoring.

2. **Conditional Logic**: Use conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE) to check the status of inputs. This determines the actions to be taken, such as adjusting outputs or setting error flags.
3. **Output Control**: Based on the conditions, control outputs like relays, motors, or actuators. This involves setting them ON or OFF or adjusting their state.

6. **Loop Execution**: The entire process is typically enclosed in a loop, repeating continuously to ensure real-time control and monitoring.

## Problem to be solved: 
Create a PLC program using structured text (ST code) to control a tank filling system. The system includes a pump, a low-level switch, and a high-level switch. The pump should start when the low-level switch is activated and stop when the high-level switch is activated.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
Inputs: low_level_switch, high_level_switch
Outputs: pump

## Planning:
1. Declare required variables for the pump, low-level switch, and high-level switch.
2. Implement a continuous loop to monitor the state of the low-level switch and high-level switch.
3. Use conditional logic to check if the low-level switch is activated.
4. If the low-level switch is activated, set the pump output to TRUE (ON).
5. Check if the high-level switch is activated.
6. If the high-level switch is activated, set the pump output to FALSE (OFF).
7. Ensure the loop continues to execute, allowing real-time monitoring and control.
8. Implement error handling routines to manage any potential malfunctions or unexpected states.
