# The task is to design a PLC program using Structured Text (ST) that implements a function block to calculate the Fibonacci number. If the output could exceed the bound of INT (32767), the program should return the max value of 32767 using Saturation Arithmetic. The program should initialize an input value NN (default is 5) and calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the NN-th term. It must handle edge cases where NN is less than or equal to 2 by returning 1.

# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Define a function block named FB_Fibonacci_Calculator.
2. Set up input and output variables, with the input N defaulted to 5.
3. Initialize auxiliary variables F1 and F2 for the first two Fibonacci numbers, and a counter CNT.
4. For the edge cases where N <= 2, set the output O to 1.
5. Use a WHILE loop to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to the N-th term.
6. Implement Saturation Arithmetic to cap the output at 32767 if exceeded.
7. Update F1 and F2 iteratively and increment the counter until the N-th term is reached.

# Tutorial: Iterative Approach with Saturation Arithmetic
To solve problems like calculating Fibonacci numbers while handling overflow, you can use an iterative approach with saturation arithmetic:
1. **Initialization**: Start by defining variables to hold initial values of the sequence, typically the first two Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Directly handle base cases where the result is known without iteration (e.g., N = 1 or 2 for Fibonacci).
3. **Iterative Calculation**: Use a loop to iteratively calculate the desired sequence up to the N-th term. In each iteration, update the sequence values.
4. **Saturation Arithmetic**: Implement checks to ensure that if the calculated value exceeds a pre-defined limit (e.g., INT max), it is capped at this value. This is useful in environments where overflow could cause errors or undefined behavior.
5. **Sequence Update**: After each calculation, update the sequence variables to move to the next term.
6. **Exit Condition**: Ensure the loop has a clear exit condition once the desired term is reached.

This approach is efficient and directly addresses potential overflow issues, making it suitable for environments with fixed-width integer representations like PLCs.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Iterative calculation with saturation arithmetic.

## Problem to be solved: 
Design a PLC program using Structured Text (ST) to implement a function block that calculates the Fibonacci number. If the output exceeds the bound of INT (32767), return the max value using Saturation Arithmetic. Initialize an input value NN (default is 5) and calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the NN-th term. Handle edge cases where NN is less than or equal to 2 by returning 1.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: N = 5
- Output: 5

- Input: N = 1
- Output: 1

- Input: N = 10
- Output: 55

- Input: N = 50
- Output: 32767 (due to saturation arithmetic)

## Planning:
1. Define a function block named `FB_Fibonacci_Calculator`.
2. Set up input variable `N` with a default value of 5 and output variable `O`.
3. Initialize `F1` and `F2` to represent the first two Fibonacci numbers, and a counter `CNT`.
4. For edge cases where `N <= 2`, set the output `O` to 1.
5. Use a `WHILE` loop to calculate the Fibonacci numbers up to the N-th term.
6. Implement saturation arithmetic by capping the output `O` at 32767 if it exceeds this value during calculation.
7. Update `F1` and `F2` iteratively and increment the counter `CNT` until the loop reaches the N-th term.
