# Design a PLC function block named `LED_Control` using structured text (ST code). The function block should contain two Boolean input variables (`PB1` and `PB2`) and one Boolean output variable (`LED`). Implement logical operations such that `LED` is assigned the value resulting from a logical AND operation between `PB1` and the negation of `PB2`. The function block should represent a simple control system where `PB1` and `PB2` determine whether `LED` is on or off based on the specified logic.

## Tutorial on Boolean Logic Operations in Control Systems

Boolean logic is a fundamental concept in control systems and programming, especially in the context of programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It is used to model binary conditions, decision-making, and control processes. Here's a brief guide on how to use Boolean logic operations in control systems:

### Key Concepts:

1. **Boolean Variables**: In control systems, Boolean variables are used to represent binary states, such as ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE, or 1/0.

2. **Logical Operations**:
   - **AND**: The result is true if both operands are true. Otherwise, it is false.
   - **OR**: The result is true if at least one operand is true. Otherwise, it is false.
   - **NOT**: This unary operation inverts the state of the operand. If the operand is true, it becomes false, and vice versa.

3. **Combining Operations**: In control systems, multiple logical operations can be combined to form complex decision-making processes. The order of operations follows standard precedence rules: NOT is evaluated first, followed by AND, and then OR.

4. **Application in PLCs**: In PLC programming, Boolean logic is used to create control logic that dictates how outputs respond to inputs. This is often implemented in function blocks, ladder logic, or structured text.

### Steps to Implement Boolean Logic:

1. **Define Variables**: Identify the input and output variables. Inputs are typically sensor readings or user inputs, while outputs are actuator commands or signals.

2. **Implement Logic**: Use logical operators to implement the desired control logic. Ensure that the logic accurately reflects the control requirements.

3. **Test and Validate**: Simulate the control logic to ensure it behaves as expected under different conditions. Validate it against the system's operational requirements.

4. **Optimize**: If necessary, optimize the logic to improve efficiency or clarity.

By mastering Boolean logic operations, you can design effective control systems that respond accurately to changes in the environment or system states.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Boolean logic operations

## Problem to be solved: 
Design a PLC function block named `LED_Control` using structured text (ST code). The function block should contain two Boolean input variables (`PB1` and `PB2`) and one Boolean output variable (`LED`). Implement logical operations such that `LED` is assigned the value resulting from a logical AND operation between `PB1` and the negation of `PB2`. The function block should represent a simple control system where `PB1` and `PB2` determine whether `LED` is on or off based on the specified logic.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: PB1 = TRUE, PB2 = FALSE; Output: LED = TRUE
- Input: PB1 = TRUE, PB2 = TRUE; Output: LED = FALSE
- Input: PB1 = FALSE, PB2 = FALSE; Output: LED = FALSE

## Planning:
1. Start by identifying the variables required for the function block: two inputs (`PB1`, `PB2`) and one output (`LED`).
2. Understand the logic required: `LED` should be true if `PB1` is true and `PB2` is false.
3. Define the function block `LED_Control` in structured text, declaring the input and output variables.
4. Implement the logical operation using the AND operator and NOT operator to achieve the desired condition.
5. Complete the function block by ensuring the logic is correctly assigned to the output `LED`.

Repeat these steps as needed to ensure accuracy and efficiency in implementing the logic within the PLC environment.
