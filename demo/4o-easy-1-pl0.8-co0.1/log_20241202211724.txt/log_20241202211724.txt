<algorithm>
The algorithm required to solve the original problem is a simple logic gate operation, specifically a boolean AND operation. This is a fundamental digital logic operation where the output is TRUE only if all inputs are TRUE. 

Tutorial:
1. Understand the Logic: The AND operation is used in digital circuits to ensure all conditions are met. In programming, it's often used in control systems to check multiple conditions.
2. Define Inputs and Outputs: Clearly define the number of inputs and outputs. For an AND gate, typically two inputs and one output are used.
3. Implement the Logic: Use the AND operator (in ST, it's 'AND') to combine inputs. The result is assigned to the output variable.
4. Testing: Make sure to test the gate with all possible input combinations to ensure correctness.
5. Application: Such logical gates are used in various control applications, including safety interlocks and condition checks.

This approach can be extended to other logic gates (OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) by changing the logical operation used.

## Problem to be solved: 
Create a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) that implements a simple boolean AND gate with two boolean inputs and one boolean output. The output should be TRUE only when both inputs are TRUE.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input1: TRUE, Input2: TRUE, Output: TRUE
- Input1: TRUE, Input2: FALSE, Output: FALSE
- Input1: FALSE, Input2: TRUE, Output: FALSE
- Input1: FALSE, Input2: FALSE, Output: FALSE

## Planning:

1. Define a function block named AND_GATE.
2. Declare two boolean inputs, 'Input1' and 'Input2'.
3. Declare one boolean output, 'AndResult'.
4. Assign the logical AND operation of 'Input1' and 'Input2' to 'AndResult'.
