<description>
Design a PLC program using structured text (ST code) to implement a function block for a loop counter. The function block should increment the counter on each call, with a macro variable representing the current count and a micro variable controlling the decrementing cycle. The function block should return the current value of the counter through the output variable 'o'. If the micro variable reaches zero, the macro variable should be incremented by one and the micro should be reset to the new value of macro. Ensure the state of both macro and micro is managed to prevent negative values and that the output value 'o' is always a positive integer.

<planning>
1. Define a function block 'FB_LoopCounter' with input, output, and internal variables.
2. Initialize 'macro' and 'micro' to 1.
3. When the input 'i' is true, check if 'micro' is zero.
4. If 'micro' is zero, increment 'macro' by 1 and reset 'micro' to the value of 'macro'.
5. Assign the current 'macro' value to the output 'o'.
6. Decrement 'micro' by 1.
7. Ensure the loop counter logic is encapsulated within the function block.

<algorithm>
To solve the problem of designing a PLC program using structured text (ST code) that implements a loop counter, the primary algorithm used is a simple counter mechanism with conditional logic. This involves incrementing and decrementing values based on certain conditions. The core concept revolves around:

1. **Initialization**: Start with initial values for the counter variables.
2. **Conditional Logic**: Use conditional checks to determine when to increment the macro variable and reset the micro variable.
3. **Loop Structure**: On each call, check the conditions, update the counter variables, and output the current counter state.

Here's a high-level tutorial for solving similar problems:

- **Define Variables**: Clearly define input, output, and internal variables. Initialize them appropriately.
- **Use Conditional Statements**: Implement `IF`, `THEN`, `ELSE` statements to handle different conditions that alter the state of variables.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulate the logic within a function block or module to ensure reusability and clarity.
- **State Management**: Carefully manage the state of variables to prevent undesired behaviors, such as negative values.
- **Testing**: After implementation, simulate or run the PLC program to ensure the logic works as expected, adjusting as necessary.

This approach ensures a robust and maintainable solution for structured text programming in PLC applications.

This approach ensures a robust and maintainable solution for structured text programming in PLC applications.

## Problem to be solved:
Design a PLC program using structured text (ST code) to implement a function block for a loop counter. The function block should increment the counter on each call, with a macro variable representing the current count and a micro variable controlling the decrementing cycle. The function block should return the current value of the counter through the output variable 'o'. If the micro variable reaches zero, the macro variable should be incremented by one, and the micro should be reset to the new value of macro. Ensure the state of both macro and micro is managed to prevent negative values and that the output value 'o' is always a positive integer.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: i = TRUE
- Output: o = current macro value after processing logic

## Planning:
1. Define a function block 'FB_LoopCounter' with input, output, and internal variables.
2. Initialize 'macro' and 'micro' to 1.
3. When the input 'i' is true, check if 'micro' is zero.
4. If 'micro' is zero, increment 'macro' by 1 and reset 'micro' to the value of 'macro'.
5. Assign the current 'macro' value to the output 'o'.
6. Decrement 'micro' by 1.
7. Ensure the loop counter logic is encapsulated within the function block.
