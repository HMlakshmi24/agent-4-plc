# Problem Statement: Create a function block in Structured Text (ST) programming language for a PLC to manage two variables, aaa and bbb. The function block should increment these variables based on their comparative values and track the number of cycles the block has executed. 

The logic is as follows:
- If aaa is equal to bbb, increment aaa by 1.
- If aaa is greater than bbb, increment bbb by 1.
- If aaa is less than bbb, increment aaa by 1.

Additionally, the function block should output the difference between aaa and bbb after the increments, and also a cycle count that indicates how many times the function block has been executed.

# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Structured Text (ST) programming language.

1. Define a FUNCTION_BLOCK named FB_ValueTracker.
2. Declare input variables: aaa (DINT), bbb (DINT), and CYCLE (DINT).
3. Declare output variables: OUT (DINT) and UPDATED_CYCLE (DINT).
4. Implement the logic to compare and increment the variables aaa and bbb:
   - If aaa equals bbb, increment aaa by 1.
   - If aaa is greater than bbb, increment bbb by 1.
   - If aaa is less than bbb, increment aaa by 1.
5. Calculate the difference between aaa and bbb and assign it to OUT.
6. Increment the CYCLE counter and assign it to UPDATED_CYCLE.
7. End the function block.

Here is the Structured Text code for the given problem:

FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_ValueTracker
    VAR_INPUT
        aaa : DINT := 1;
        bbb : DINT := 0;
    END_VAR
    VAR_OUTPUT
        OUT : DINT;
        UPDATED_CYCLE : DINT;
    END_VAR
    
    VAR
        CYCLE : DINT := 0;
    END_VAR

    (* Increment logic based on comparative values *)
    IF aaa = bbb THEN
        aaa := aaa + 1;
    ELSIF aaa > bbb THEN
        bbb := bbb + 1;
    ELSE (* aaa < bbb *)
        aaa := aaa + 1;
    END_IF

    (* Calculate the difference *)
    OUT := aaa - bbb;

    (* Increment cycle counter *)
    CYCLE := CYCLE + 1;
    UPDATED_CYCLE := CYCLE;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

# Planning to solve this problem.

1. Define the function block with the necessary input and output variables.
2. Inside the function block, implement the logic to handle the comparative values between aaa and bbb.
3. Use conditional statements to increment the variables based on their comparison.
4. Calculate the output difference between the two variables.
5. Update the cycle count after each execution of the function block.
6. Assign the results to the output variables.
7. Ensure the function block is closed properly.

<algorithm>
# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
The algorithm used here is a simple conditional logic or decision-making algorithm.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

Conditional Logic Algorithm Tutorial:

1. Introduction:
   - Conditional logic is a fundamental concept in programming that allows a program to make decisions based on certain conditions. This is often implemented using if-else statements, switch-case statements, or similar constructs.

2. Basic Structure:
   - The basic structure of a conditional statement involves evaluating a condition and executing a block of code if the condition is true. If the condition is false, other code blocks can be executed using else or elseif clauses.

3. Application:
   - Conditional logic is widely used in scenarios where different outcomes are required based on varying input conditions. Examples include processing user inputs, controlling flow in automated systems, and managing game logic.

4. Steps to Implement:
   - Identify the conditions that need to be checked.
   - Write conditional statements to evaluate these conditions.
   - Specify the actions to be taken for each condition.
   - Ensure that all possible conditions are handled to avoid unexpected behavior.

5. Best Practices:
   - Keep conditions simple and readable for maintainability.
   - Avoid deep nesting of conditional statements as it can make the code harder to read and maintain.
   - Use else and elseif clauses judiciously to cover all scenarios.
   - Regularly test conditional logic to ensure correctness across different inputs.

By following these principles, programmers can effectively manage decision-making processes within their software applications.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the problem:
Conditional Logic Algorithm

## Problem to be solved: 
Create a function block in Structured Text (ST) programming language for a PLC to manage two variables, aaa and bbb. The function block should increment these variables based on their comparative values and track the number of cycles the block has executed. The function block should output the difference between aaa and bbb, and a cycle count indicating how many times the function block has been executed.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
Since this is a programming logic problem in Structured Text, there are no traditional inputs/outputs. The function block operates within a PLC environment, manipulating variables as described and outputting the difference and cycle count.

## Planning:
1. Define a FUNCTION_BLOCK named FB_ValueTracker.
2. Declare input variables: aaa (DINT) and bbb (DINT).
3. Declare output variables: OUT (DINT) and UPDATED_CYCLE (DINT).
4. Initialize a local variable CYCLE (DINT) to keep track of execution count.
5. Implement conditional logic to compare and increment variables:
   - If aaa equals bbb, increment aaa by 1.
   - If aaa is greater than bbb, increment bbb by 1.
   - If aaa is less than bbb, increment aaa by 1.
6. Calculate the difference between aaa and bbb and assign to OUT for output.
7. Increment the CYCLE variable each time the function block executes and assign to UPDATED_CYCLE for output.
8. End the function block definition ensuring proper closure.
