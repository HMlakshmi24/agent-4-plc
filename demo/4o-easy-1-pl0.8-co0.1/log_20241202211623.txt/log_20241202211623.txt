# The problem is to create a function block in Structured Text (ST) programming language for a PLC that compares two integer input values, Value1 and Value2, and determines the larger value. The larger value should be assigned to an output variable, MaxValue. This functionality must be executed within a single PLC cycle.

# Planning to solve this problem.

1. Define a function block called FIND_MAX_VALUE. This is the container for our logic.
2. Inside the function block, declare two input variables, Value1 and Value2, both of type INT. These represent the two integer inputs that will be compared.
3. Declare an output variable, MaxValue, of type INT. This will hold the maximum of the two input values.
4. Use an IF-ELSE statement to compare Value1 and Value2:
   a. If Value1 is greater than Value2, assign Value1 to MaxValue.
   b. Otherwise, assign Value2 to MaxValue.
5. Ensure that the function block executes the comparison and assignment in a single PLC cycle, which is inherent in the function block execution.

<algorithm>
# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
# The algorithm used here is a simple comparison or conditional check, which is a form of Brute-force technique. It tests each possible condition (in this case, comparing two values) and determines the result based on these checks.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

## Brute-force Algorithm Tutorial:

Brute-force is a straightforward approach to solving problems based on checking all possible solutions and selecting the best one. It involves generating all potential solutions and evaluating each one to find the optimal solution. Here are some key points on using brute-force:

1. **Definition**: A brute-force algorithm is the most simple and general solution to a problem. It systematically enumerates all possible candidates for the solution and checks whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.

2. **Application**: Brute-force algorithms are applicable when the solution space is small enough to be completely enumerated or when other more efficient algorithms are not available.

3. **Advantages**: 
   - Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
   - Generality: Can be applied to a wide range of problems without significant adaptation.

4. **Disadvantages**:
   - Inefficiency: Can be very slow and resource-intensive, especially for large input sizes.
   - Not suitable for problems with large solution spaces.

5. **Example**: A common brute-force problem is finding the largest number in a list. The brute-force solution involves checking each number in the list and keeping track of the largest number found.

6. **Optimization**: Often, brute-force solutions can be optimized by using heuristics or other algorithmic strategies to reduce the search space or eliminate unnecessary checks.

In summary, brute-force is a fundamental algorithmic technique that can be effective for small-scale problems or when other methods are not feasible. It serves as a baseline for developing more complex and efficient solutions.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Brute-force

## Problem to be solved:
Create a function block in Structured Text (ST) programming language for a PLC that compares two integer input values, Value1 and Value2, and determines the larger value. The larger value should be assigned to an output variable, MaxValue. This functionality must be executed within a single PLC cycle.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: Value1 = 10, Value2 = 20
- Output: MaxValue = 20

# Planning:

1. Define a function block named `FIND_MAX_VALUE` to contain the logic for the comparison.
2. Declare two input variables within the function block:
   - `Value1` of type `INT`
   - `Value2` of type `INT`
3. Declare an output variable:
   - `MaxValue` of type `INT`
4. Implement an IF-ELSE statement to compare the input values:
   - If `Value1` is greater than `Value2`, assign `Value1` to `MaxValue`.
   - Otherwise, assign `Value2` to `MaxValue`.
5. Ensure that this logic executes within a single PLC cycle, as dictated by the function block execution.
