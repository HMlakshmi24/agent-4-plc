<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve the original problem is straightforward boolean logic. The AND gate function block applies the basic logical AND operation, where the output is TRUE only if both inputs are TRUE. This is a fundamental concept in digital logic design.

### Tutorial on Boolean Logic in PLC Programming:

1. **Logic Gates**: Logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT are the building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions that are essential for decision-making in PLCs.

2. **AND Gate**: The AND operation checks if multiple conditions are TRUE simultaneously. In ST, this is implemented using the `AND` keyword. For example, `Output := Input1 AND Input2;` gives TRUE only if both Input1 and Input2 are TRUE.

3. **OR Gate**: The OR operation evaluates to TRUE if at least one of the conditions is TRUE. In ST, it is implemented using the `OR` keyword.

4. **NOT Gate**: The NOT operation inverts the logical state of its input. In ST, it is implemented using the `NOT` keyword.

5. **Structured Text (ST)**: A high-level programming language that resembles Pascal, used in PLCs for writing control algorithms. It supports complex data structures, loops, conditionals, and logical operations.

6. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function block using `FUNCTION_BLOCK`.
   - Declare input and output variables using `VAR_INPUT` and `VAR_OUTPUT`.
   - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to implement the desired logic.
   - Use boolean data types for inputs and outputs.

This foundational understanding of boolean logic and Structured Text is crucial for developing control systems in industrial automation. Practicing these logic gates in ST helps in creating more complex logic controllers and understanding the decision-making processes in PLCs.
