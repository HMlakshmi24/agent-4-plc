<description>
Design a Function Block in Structured Text (ST) named dw, which takes an integer input (i) and returns an integer output (o). The function block includes an internal integer variable (ss) that increments by 1 each time the block is executed. If the input i is equal to 1, the output o should be set to 1. Otherwise, o should be set to the current value of ss.

Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Structured Text programming language.

1. Define a function block named "dw".
2. Inside the function block, declare an integer input variable "i".
3. Declare an integer internal variable "ss" initialized to 0.
4. Declare an integer output variable "o".
5. Each time the function block is executed, increment "ss" by 1.
6. Check if the input "i" is equal to 1.
7. If "i" is equal to 1, set the output "o" to 1.
8. Otherwise, set the output "o" to the current value of "ss".

Here is the implementation in Structured Text:

FUNCTION_BLOCK dw
VAR_INPUT
    i: INT;
END_VAR
VAR
    ss: INT := 0; // Initialize ss to 0
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    o: INT;
END_VAR

// Main logic
ss := ss + 1; // Increment ss by 1 each time the block is executed

IF i = 1 THEN
    o := 1; // Set output to 1 if input i is 1
ELSE
    o := ss; // Otherwise, set output to the current value of ss
END_IF

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define a function block named "dw" in Structured Text.
2. Declare the input variable "i" and initialize the internal variable "ss" to 0.
3. Declare the output variable "o".
4. Implement the logic to increment "ss" each time the function block is executed.
5. Use a conditional statement to check if "i" equals 1, and set "o" accordingly.
6. Ensure the function block correctly updates "o" based on the value of "i".
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm needed to solve the original problem is a simple state management with conditional logic.

Tutorial:
1. State Management: The internal variable "ss" is used to keep track of the number of times the function block has been executed. This is implemented by incrementing "ss" each time the block is run.

2. Conditional Logic: The conditional logic checks the value of the input "i". If "i" is equal to 1, the output "o" is set to 1. Otherwise, "o" is set to the current value of the internal state variable "ss".

3. Function Blocks in ST: Function blocks in Structured Text are reusable code components that encapsulate a set of operations. They can have input, output, and internal variables. Each time a function block is executed, it processes the inputs and updates its outputs and internal state.

This approach is efficient for problems involving state management and simple conditional checks in industrial automation and control systems. By breaking down the problem and implementing it step by step in a function block, we can achieve a modular and reusable solution.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The algorithm needed to solve the original problem is a simple state management with conditional logic.

## Problem to be solved:
Design a Function Block in Structured Text (ST) named dw, which takes an integer input (i) and returns an integer output (o). The function block includes an internal integer variable (ss) that increments by 1 each time the block is executed. If the input i is equal to 1, the output o should be set to 1. Otherwise, o should be set to the current value of ss.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Sample Input: i = 1
- Sample Output: o = 1

- Sample Input: i = 0 (first execution)
- Sample Output: o = 1

- Sample Input: i = 0 (second execution)
- Sample Output: o = 2

# Planning:
1. Define a function block named "dw" in Structured Text.
2. Declare the input variable "i" and initialize the internal variable "ss" to 0.
3. Declare the output variable "o".
4. Implement the logic to increment "ss" each time the function block is executed.
5. Use a conditional statement to check if "i" equals 1, and set "o" accordingly.
6. Ensure the function block correctly updates "o" based on the value of "i".
