# The problem involves creating a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST) to evaluate whether a critical motor should be activated based on a low pressure reading. The activation is determined by comparing the input pressure value to a predefined threshold. If the pressure is below the threshold, the motor should be triggered.

# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in ST programming language.
1. Define the function block named `FB_MotorControl`.
2. Declare the input variable `Pressure_LOW` of type REAL.
3. Declare the output variable `Motor_Critical` of type BOOL.
4. Declare a local variable `Threshold` and set it to 36464.
5. Implement the logic to compare `Pressure_LOW` with `Threshold`.
6. If `Pressure_LOW` is less than `Threshold`, set `Motor_Critical` to TRUE.
7. Otherwise, set `Motor_Critical` to FALSE.

ST Code:
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_MotorControl

# Identify the algorithm that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
The algorithm primarily involves conditional logic based on comparison, which is a form of decision-making logic commonly used in control systems. This is often implemented using simple if-else structures.

# Tutorial about the algorithm:
## Conditional Logic and Decision-Making in Structured Text (ST)
In PLC programming, decision-making is crucial for controlling processes and systems. The Structured Text (ST) language provides constructs like `IF`, `ELSE`, and `ELSIF` to implement conditional logic efficiently. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **IF-ELSE Structure**: This is used to evaluate conditions and execute corresponding actions. The basic syntax involves:
   - `IF` condition `THEN` execute some code.
   - Optionally, use `ELSIF` for additional conditions.
   - `ELSE` provides a default action if none of the conditions are met.

2. **Comparison Operators**: These include `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` and are used to compare variables or constants.

3. **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple conditions using `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

4. **Application**: Use decision-making to control outputs based on inputs. For instance, turning a motor on or off based on sensor readings like pressure or level.

When designing control logic, ensure conditions are well-defined, and actions are clear to maintain system stability and performance. This approach is fundamental in creating reliable automation solutions.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
In PLC programming, the algorithm involves implementing conditional logic for decision-making using the `IF-ELSE` structure. This process includes evaluating conditions and executing actions based on those conditions. The use of comparison operators and logical operators allows for precise control in automated systems.

## Problem to be solved:
Design a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) to evaluate whether a critical motor should be activated based on a low pressure reading. The activation is determined by comparing the input pressure value to a predefined threshold. If the pressure is below the threshold, the motor should be triggered.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- **Input:** Pressure_LOW = 35000  
  **Output:** Motor_Critical = TRUE
- **Input:** Pressure_LOW = 37000  
  **Output:** Motor_Critical = FALSE

# Planning:
1. Understand the requirements for evaluating the critical motor based on pressure.
2. Define the function block named `FB_MotorControl` in Structured Text (ST).
3. Declare the input variable `Pressure_LOW` of type REAL.
4. Declare the output variable `Motor_Critical` of type BOOL.
5. Declare a local variable `Threshold` with a constant value of 36464.
6. Implement the logic to compare `Pressure_LOW` with `Threshold` using an `IF-ELSE` structure.
7. If `Pressure_LOW` is less than `Threshold`, set `Motor_Critical` to TRUE.
8. If `Pressure_LOW` is not less than `Threshold`, set `Motor_Critical` to FALSE.
9. Ensure the function block adheres to the prescribed format and logic without unnecessary complexity.
