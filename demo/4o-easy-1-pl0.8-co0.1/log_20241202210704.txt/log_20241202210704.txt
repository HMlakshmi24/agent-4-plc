# Design a function block (FB) in Structured Text (ST) for a PLC program involving two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to 10, and the inner loop iterates from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. During each iteration, if a flag is TRUE, the loop exits and the count is updated to keep track of how many times the inner loop executed, ensuring that the count does not exceed the maximum expected iterations and loop variables remain within their defined bounds.

# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Initialize the necessary variables: i, j, flag, and count. Set count to 0 initially.
2. Define a maximum count variable based on the known maximum possible iterations of the inner loop.
3. Create the outer loop to iterate i from 0 to 10.
4. Within the outer loop, create the inner loop to iterate j from 10 to 100 with a step of 2.
5. Inside the inner loop, check if the flag is TRUE. If it is, exit both loops.
6. Increment the count variable to track the number of inner loop executions.
7. Ensure count does not exceed the maximum expected iterations; if it does, exit the loop.

<algorithm>
# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
The algorithm for this problem involves a simple iterative approach using nested loops, which is a form of brute-force algorithm. This approach systematically explores all possible iterations within the defined bounds without employing advanced techniques like recursion or optimization.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.
Brute-force algorithms are straightforward methods where all possible solutions are explored to find the correct one. In the context of nested loops, the approach involves iterating over a series of possible values systematically. This process is often used when the problem size is manageable, and all potential combinations or iterations need to be assessed.

In structured text programming for PLCs, nested loops are used to perform repetitive tasks over a range of values. The loops can be controlled using conditional statements to break out of the loop based on certain criteria, such as a flag variable in this case. It is important to ensure that the loop variables stay within their defined bounds and that any counters used to track iterations do not exceed their expected maximum values.

To implement a brute-force approach in a PLC program:
1. Define the loop variables and any counters needed.
2. Set up the outer loop with its defined range and step size.
3. Nest the inner loop within the outer loop, also with a defined range and step size.
4. Use conditional statements within the loops to manage control flow, such as exiting loops early if certain conditions are met.
5. Update any counters or variables as needed during each iteration.
6. Ensure that there are checks to prevent exceeding maximum expected iterations or variable bounds.

This method is simple and effective for problems where exhaustive exploration of possibilities is feasible and necessary for the solution. However, for larger problem sizes or more complex scenarios, more advanced algorithms may be required to optimize performance and efficiency.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The algorithm for this problem involves a simple iterative approach using nested loops, which is a form of brute-force algorithm. This approach systematically explores all possible iterations within the defined bounds without employing advanced techniques like recursion or optimization.

## Problem to be solved:
Design a function block (FB) in Structured Text (ST) for a PLC program involving two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to 10, and the inner loop iterates from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. During each iteration, if a flag is TRUE, the loop exits and the count is updated to keep track of how many times the inner loop executed, ensuring that the count does not exceed the maximum expected iterations and loop variables remain within their defined bounds.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: 
  - A flag variable that can be TRUE or FALSE during the loop execution.
- Output: 
  - The number of times the inner loop was executed, stored in a counter variable.

## Planning:
1. Initialize the necessary variables: `i`, `j`, `flag`, and `count`. Set `count` to 0 initially.
2. Define a `maxCount` variable based on the known maximum possible iterations of the inner loop.
3. Create the outer loop to iterate `i` from 0 to 10.
4. Within the outer loop, create the inner loop to iterate `j` from 10 to 100 with a step of 2.
5. Inside the inner loop, check if the `flag` is TRUE. If it is, exit both loops.
6. Increment the `count` variable to track the number of inner loop executions.
7. Ensure `count` does not exceed the maximum expected iterations; if it does, exit the loop.
8. Close both loops and the function block.
