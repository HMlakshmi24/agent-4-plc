# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Define a function block named TOGGLE_OUTPUT.
2. Declare an input variable 'Button' of type BOOL to receive the button's state.
3. Declare an output variable 'ToggledOutput' of type BOOL with an initial value of FALSE to store the toggled state.
4. Declare an internal variable 'PrevButtonState' of type BOOL with an initial value of FALSE to keep track of the previous button state.
5. Implement logic to check if the button is pressed and the previous button state was not pressed.
6. If true, toggle the 'ToggledOutput' state.
7. Update 'PrevButtonState' with the current button state.
8. Ensure the function block captures the transition effectively in a single PLC cycle.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
The algorithm used in this problem is event-driven logic or state management, which is commonly used in PLC programming to handle input transitions and state toggling.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.
Event-driven logic in PLC programming involves handling specific events or changes in state, such as button presses, to execute certain logic. These systems are often designed to respond to events like inputs changing from FALSE to TRUE or vice versa, and then perform specific actions based on these changes.

Here's a high-level approach to designing event-driven logic for state management:

1. **State Variables**: Define variables to keep track of the current and previous states of inputs. This is crucial for detecting changes or transitions.

2. **Transition Detection**: Implement logic to detect the specific transition event you're interested in, such as a button being pressed. This typically involves checking if the current state is TRUE and the previous state was FALSE.

3. **Action Execution**: Once a transition is detected, execute the desired action, such as toggling an output or triggering another process.

4. **State Update**: After executing the action, update the state variables to reflect the current state of inputs. This ensures that the system is ready to detect the next transition.

5. **Cycle Timing**: Ensure that the logic is executed within a single cycle to accurately capture transitions. This is critical in PLC systems where timing and cycle execution are precise.

By following these steps, you can create robust event-driven logic for handling input transitions and maintaining accurate state management in PLC applications.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Event-driven logic or state management, commonly used in PLC programming to handle input transitions and state toggling.

## Problem to be solved: 
A function block in Structured Text (ST) is needed to toggle a boolean output each time a button is pressed. The function block should ensure that the output reflects the correct toggled state based on the button's transition from not pressed to pressed, capturing state changes effectively in a single PLC cycle.

## Planning:
1. Define a function block named `TOGGLE_OUTPUT`.
2. Declare an input variable `Button` of type `BOOL` to receive the button's state.
3. Declare an output variable `ToggledOutput` of type `BOOL` with an initial value of `FALSE` to store the toggled state.
4. Declare an internal variable `PrevButtonState` of type `BOOL` with an initial value of `FALSE` to keep track of the previous button state.
5. Implement logic to check if the button is pressed and the previous button state was not pressed.
6. If true, toggle the `ToggledOutput` state.
7. Update `PrevButtonState` with the current button state.
8. Ensure the function block captures the transition effectively in a single PLC cycle.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: Button = `TRUE` (pressed), Previous Button = `FALSE` (not pressed)
- Output: ToggledOutput = `TRUE` (toggle state to true)

- Input: Button = `TRUE` (pressed), Previous Button = `TRUE` (pressed)
- Output: ToggledOutput = `TRUE` (no change, as it is not a new press)

- Input: Button = `FALSE` (not pressed), Previous Button = `TRUE` (pressed)
- Output: ToggledOutput = `TRUE` (no change, waiting for next press)

- Input: Button = `TRUE` (pressed), Previous Button = `FALSE` (not pressed)
- Output: ToggledOutput = `FALSE` (toggle state to false)
