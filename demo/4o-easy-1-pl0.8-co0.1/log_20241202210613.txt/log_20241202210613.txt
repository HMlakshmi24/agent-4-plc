<description>
Design a Structured Text (ST) code for a PLC function block named 'CALCULATE_OUTPUT'. The function block takes an integer input 'i' and produces an integer output 'o'. The output is determined based on the following conditions: if the input 'i' is 0, the output 'o' is 0; if 'i' is between 1 and 5, 'o' is the square of 'i'; if 'i' is between 6 and 10, 'o' is equal to 'i' plus two times 'i'; otherwise, 'o' is assigned a value of -1. Ensure valid bounds for 'i' and that 'o' never takes undefined or invalid values.

1. Define the function block with the name 'CALCULATE_OUTPUT'.
2. Declare the input variable 'i' and the output variable 'o' as integers.
3. Use a local variable 'result' to hold intermediate calculations.
4. Implement conditional logic using IF-ELSIF-ELSE statements:
   - If 'i' equals 0, set 'result' to 0.
   - If 'i' is between 1 and 5, set 'result' to the square of 'i'.
   - If 'i' is between 6 and 10, set 'result' to 'i' plus two times 'i'.
   - Otherwise, set 'result' to -1.
5. Assign 'result' to the output variable 'o'.
6. Ensure the function block handles invalid inputs by setting default output values.

<algorithm>
In this problem, a conditional logic approach is used to determine the output based on different input ranges. Conditional logic is a fundamental programming concept where different actions are executed based on the evaluation of conditions. This is often implemented using IF-THEN-ELSE statements, which are used to control the flow of the program based on certain criteria.

Tutorial on Conditional Logic:
1. **Understand the Conditions**: Break down the problem into a series of conditions that need to be checked. Each condition should be mutually exclusive or cover all possible cases.

2. **Structure the IF-THEN-ELSE Statement**:
   - Start with an `IF` statement to check the first condition.
   - Use `ELSIF` for additional conditions.
   - Conclude with an `ELSE` statement to handle any cases not covered by the previous conditions.

3. **Order of Evaluation**: Ensure that the conditions are ordered logically and that more specific conditions are evaluated before more general ones to avoid incorrect results.

4. **Assignments and Actions**: Within each condition, perform the necessary calculations or actions and assign the results to the output variables.

5. **Testing**: Test the conditional logic thoroughly to ensure all possible cases are handled correctly.

This approach is not only applicable in programming PLCs with Structured Text but also in other programming languages where decision-making based on conditions is required.

## Problem to be solved: 
Design a Structured Text (ST) code for a PLC function block named 'CALCULATE_OUTPUT'. The function block takes an integer input 'i' and produces an integer output 'o'. The output is determined based on the following conditions: if the input 'i' is 0, the output 'o' is 0; if 'i' is between 1 and 5, 'o' is the square of 'i'; if 'i' is between 6 and 10, 'o' is equal to 'i' plus two times 'i'; otherwise, 'o' is assigned a value of -1. Ensure valid bounds for 'i' and that 'o' never takes undefined or invalid values.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: i = 0; Output: o = 0
- Input: i = 3; Output: o = 9
- Input: i = 7; Output: o = 21
- Input: i = 11; Output: o = -1

## Planning:
1. Define the function block with the name 'CALCULATE_OUTPUT'.
2. Declare the input variable 'i' and the output variable 'o' as integers.
3. Use a local variable 'result' to hold intermediate calculations.
4. Implement conditional logic using IF-ELSIF-ELSE statements:
   - If 'i' equals 0, set 'result' to 0.
   - If 'i' is between 1 and 5, set 'result' to the square of 'i'.
   - If 'i' is between 6 and 10, set 'result' to 'i' plus two times 'i'.
   - Otherwise, set 'result' to -1.
5. Assign 'result' to the output variable 'o'.
6. Ensure the function block handles invalid inputs by setting default output values.
