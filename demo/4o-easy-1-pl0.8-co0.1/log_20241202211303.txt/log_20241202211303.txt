# Create a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST) that receives an integer input and returns two integer outputs. 
The first output should equal the input value, while the second output should be set to a constant value of 43.
</description>
<code>
# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Structured Text (ST) programming language.

1. Define the function block named `constantprogram`.
2. Declare the input variable `i` of type `INT`.
3. Declare the output variables `o` and `c` of type `INT`.
4. In the function block, assign the input `i` to the output `o`.
5. Set the output `c` to the constant value 43.

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK constantprogram
VAR_INPUT
    i : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    o : INT;
    c : INT;
END_VAR

o := i;
c := 43;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```
</code>
<planning>
# Planning to solve this problem.
1. Define the function block with a clear name `constantprogram`.
2. Within the function block, declare the required input and output variables with their respective data types.
3. Assign the input variable directly to the first output variable to ensure the output mirrors the input.
4. Assign the constant value 43 to the second output variable.
5. End the function block ensuring proper syntax and structure are maintained.

<algorithm>
# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
The algorithm used here does not fit the traditional algorithm categories as it is a simple assignment and constant setting task in PLC programming.

# Structured Text programming is typically used in PLCs for industrial control systems. 
It is similar to high-level languages like Pascal. The creation of a function block is a fundamental task in PLC programming where inputs are processed to produce outputs,
often used to modularize and reuse code. 

# Tutorial for Structured Text Function Block Creation:
1. **Understand the Requirements**: Know the inputs, outputs, and the desired transformation or logic.
2. **Define the Function Block**: Use the `FUNCTION_BLOCK` keyword followed by the block's name.
3. **Declare Inputs/Outputs**: Use `VAR_INPUT` and `VAR_OUTPUT` sections to declare input/output variables with types.
4. **Implement Logic**: Perform operations or assignments needed to achieve the desired output from the input.
5. **Syntax and Structure**: Ensure that the syntax is correct with proper delimiters and terminators (`END_VAR`, `END_FUNCTION_BLOCK`).
6. **Test and Validate**: Although testing is not included in this task, ensure that the block works as intended when integrated into a larger program.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next 
problem:
The task involves simple assignment and constant settings in a PLC program using Structured Text, which does not fit traditional algorithm categories like Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, etc. This is more about understanding PLC programming basics for function block creation.

## Problem to be solved:
Create a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST) that receives an integer input and returns two integer outputs. The first output should equal the input value, while the second output should be set to a constant value of 43.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: `i = 5`
- Outputs: `o = 5`, `c = 43`

# Planning: 
1. Define the function block with a clear name `constantprogram`.
2. Within the function block, declare the required input variable `i` of type `INT` and output variables `o` and `c` of type `INT`.
3. Assign the input variable `i` directly to the output variable `o`.
4. Assign the constant value 43 to the output variable `c`.
5. End the function block ensuring proper syntax and structure are maintained.
