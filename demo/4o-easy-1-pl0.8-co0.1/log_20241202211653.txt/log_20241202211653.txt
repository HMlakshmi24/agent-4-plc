# Implement a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) to simulate a NOT gate. The function block should have one boolean input named 'Input' and one boolean output named 'NegatedOutput'. The output should always be the logical negation of the input.
</description>
<code>
# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Structured Text (ST) programming language.

1. Define a FUNCTION_BLOCK named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare a VAR_INPUT section to define the input variable 'Input' of type BOOL.
3. Declare a VAR_OUTPUT section to define the output variable 'NegatedOutput' of type BOOL.
4. In the body of the function block, assign 'NegatedOutput' the negation of 'Input' using the NOT operator.

Here is the Structured Text code for the NOT_GATE function block:

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK NOT_GATE
  VAR_INPUT
    Input : BOOL;
  END_VAR
  VAR_OUTPUT
    NegatedOutput : BOOL;
  END_VAR

  NegatedOutput := NOT Input;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```
</code>
<planning>
# Planning to solve this problem.

1. Start by defining the FUNCTION_BLOCK named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare the input and output variables within the appropriate sections: VAR_INPUT for the input and VAR_OUTPUT for the output.
3. Implement the logic inside the function block by setting the output 'NegatedOutput' to the logical negation of the input 'Input'.
4. Ensure that this logic is executed whenever the function block is called, providing the correct NOT gate functionality.
5. Validate the function block by integrating it into a PLC project to test its behavior with various boolean inputs.

Tutorial on Logical Operations in PLC Programming:

Logical operations are fundamental to PLC programming and are used to perform basic logic functions like AND, OR, and NOT. These operations are essential for decision-making processes in control systems.

1. **Understanding Logic Gates**: 
   - Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. The basic gates include AND, OR, and NOT.
   - A NOT gate inverts the input signal. If the input is true (1), the output is false (0), and vice versa.

2. **Structured Text (ST) Language**:
   - ST is a high-level textual programming language used in PLCs. It resembles traditional programming languages like Pascal or C.
   - ST allows for complex expressions and control structures, making it versatile for implementing logical operations.

3. **Implementing Logic in ST**:
   - Define input and output variables, specifying their data types.
   - Use logical operators to define the desired logic. For a NOT gate, use the NOT operator to invert the input signal.

4. **Application in PLCs**:
   - Logical operations are crucial for automation tasks, where they control the flow of operations based on conditions.
   - They are used in safety systems, process control, and any application requiring decision-making.

By understanding and implementing these basic logic operations, one can effectively develop and troubleshoot PLC programs to control automated systems.

Given a competitive programming problem, generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The algorithm used to solve this problem is a simple logical operation, which can be categorized as a direct computation or a basic logical operation.

## Problem to be solved: 
Implement a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) to simulate a NOT gate. The function block should have one boolean input named 'Input' and one boolean output named 'NegatedOutput'. The output should always be the logical negation of the input.

## Planning:
1. Start by defining the FUNCTION_BLOCK named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare the input variable 'Input' of type BOOL in a VAR_INPUT section.
3. Declare the output variable 'NegatedOutput' of type BOOL in a VAR_OUTPUT section.
4. Within the function block's body, use the NOT operator to assign 'NegatedOutput' as the negation of 'Input'.
5. Ensure that this logic executes correctly every time the function block is called.
6. Validate the function block by testing it in a PLC environment with different boolean inputs to verify its NOT gate functionality.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Sample Input: Input = TRUE
  - Sample Output: NegatedOutput = FALSE
  
- Sample Input: Input = FALSE
  - Sample Output: NegatedOutput = TRUE
