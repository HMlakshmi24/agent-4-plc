<description>
The problem involves creating a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) that manages and increments two integer variables, aaa and bbb, based on their comparative values. The function block should also maintain a cycle counter to track how many times it has been executed and output the difference between the two variables after processing.

<planning>
1. Define a function block called FB_ValueTracker with input variables aaa, bbb, and CYCLE.
2. Declare output variables OUT and UPDATED_CYCLE to hold the results.
3. Increment the CYCLE variable to keep track of how many times the function block is executed.
4. Use a conditional statement to compare aaa and bbb:
   - If they are equal, increment aaa by 1.
   - If aaa is greater than bbb, increment bbb by 1.
   - If aaa is less than bbb, increment aaa by 1.
5. Calculate the difference between aaa and bbb and assign it to OUT.
6. Assign the incremented CYCLE value to UPDATED_CYCLE for output.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve this problem is a simple conditional logic-based approach. This falls under the category of structured programming rather than a specific algorithm like Dynamic Programming or Greedy. 

Tutorial:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: Identify the requirements and constraints of the problem. In this case, we need to compare two variables and increment them based on their relative values.
2. **Function Block Structure**: Define the structure of the function block. In PLC programming, function blocks are reusable components that encapsulate logic.
3. **Conditional Statements**: Use conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE) to manage the logic based on the comparison of the two variables.
4. **Variable Management**: Properly manage and update both input and output variables within the function block.
5. **Cycle Tracking**: Implement a cycle counter that increments with each execution of the function block to monitor how many times the logic has been applied.
6. **Output Results**: Ensure the output reflects the desired results, in this case, the difference between the two variables and the updated cycle count.
7. **Testing**: After implementing the function block, it is essential to test its behavior with various input scenarios to ensure correctness.
