<description>
Design a PLC function block that takes an integer input and produces two integer outputs, where one output mirrors the input and the other is a constant value.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK constantprogram
VAR_INPUT
    i : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    o : INT;
    c : INT;
END_VAR
BEGIN
    o := i;  // Assign input value to output 'o'
    c := 43; // Assign constant value 43 to output 'c'
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the function block using the FUNCTION_BLOCK keyword.
2. Declare the input variable 'i' using VAR_INPUT.
3. Declare the output variables 'o' and 'c' using VAR_OUTPUT.
4. In the body of the function block, assign the input 'i' to output 'o'.
5. Assign the constant value 43 to output 'c'.
6. Ensure that the function block is properly closed with the END_FUNCTION_BLOCK command.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used in this solution is straightforward assignment. The inputs are directly mapped to the outputs without any complex logic or iterations. 

Tutorial for Assignment Algorithm:
1. Understand the variables: Identify the input and output variables in your function or program.
2. Use the assignment operator: In most programming languages, you can assign a value to a variable using the "=" operator. The value on the right will be assigned to the variable on the left.
3. Ensure proper data types: Make sure that the types of the variables on both sides of the assignment operator are compatible.
4. Test the output: After assignment, check the outputs to ensure they hold the expected values.
5. Encapsulate in a function/block: If needed, wrap your logic in a function or a block for better organization and reusability.

# Problem: Design a PLC function block that takes an integer input and produces two integer outputs, where one output mirrors the input and the other is a constant value.
# Planning: 
1. Define the function block using the FUNCTION_BLOCK keyword named `constantprogram`.
2. Declare an input variable 'i' of type INT using VAR_INPUT.
3. Declare two output variables 'o' and 'c' of type INT using VAR_OUTPUT.
4. In the body of the function block, assign the input variable 'i' to output variable 'o' using the assignment operator.
5. Assign the constant value 43 to output variable 'c'.
6. Ensure that the function block is properly closed with the END_FUNCTION_BLOCK command.
