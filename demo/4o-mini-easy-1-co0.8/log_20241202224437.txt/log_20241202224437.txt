<description>
The problem is to design a PLC function block in structured text (ST) to process multiple emergency stop signals. The function block should take several emergency stop input signals and generate corresponding output signals that are the logical NOT of those inputs.

<planning>
1. Define a function block named FB_Estop_Processor.
2. Create input variables for each emergency stop signal.
3. Create output variables to hold the inverted values of the input signals.
4. Implement the logical NOT operation for each input signal.
5. Ensure the outputs reflect the emergency stop activation status correctly.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used in this problem is a simple logical inversion, which can be categorized under the concept of Boolean Algebra. 

Tutorial for Boolean Algebra:
1. **Understanding Boolean Variables**: Boolean variables can hold one of two values: TRUE (1) or FALSE (0). In control systems, these variables are often used for signaling states, such as emergency stops.
  
2. **Logical Operations**: The basic logical operations include AND, OR, and NOT. The NOT operation, in particular, is used to invert the state of a Boolean variable. For example, if a signal indicates an emergency stop (TRUE), the NOT operation will convert it to FALSE, indicating that the system is not in an emergency state.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define input and output variables in your function block.
   - Use the NOT operator to invert each input signal.
   - Assign the result of the NOT operation to the corresponding output variable.

4. **Testing**: After implementing the function block, you should test it with various combinations of input signals to ensure that the output accurately reflects the logical inversion of each input.

By following these principles, you can effectively utilize Boolean logic in PLC programming to handle various control tasks, such as processing emergency stop signals.
