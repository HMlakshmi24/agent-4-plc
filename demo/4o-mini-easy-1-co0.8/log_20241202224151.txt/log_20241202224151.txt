<description>
The problem involves creating a function block (FB) in Structured Text (ST) for a programmable logic controller (PLC). The FB must include two nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from 0 to 10, and the inner loop iterates from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. Additionally, the design should include a flag to exit the loops early, and a count variable to track the number of times the inner loop executes without exceeding a defined maximum.

<planning>
1. Define the function block with necessary variables including counters and flags.
2. Implement the outer loop iterating from 0 to 10.
3. Within the outer loop, implement the inner loop iterating from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2.
4. Inside the inner loop, check for the flag condition to exit if it is TRUE.
5. Increment the count variable during each iteration of the inner loop.
6. Implement a check to ensure that the count does not exceed the defined maximum (e.g., 100).
7. If the maximum is reached, handle the case appropriately (e.g., resetting or capping the count).
8. End both loops correctly and ensure proper termination of the function block.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm to be used here can be categorized as a combination of iterative control (for loops) and conditional checks. 
The loops are structured in a nested manner, where the inner loop is dependent on the outer loop's index. 

### Tutorial on Iterative Control with Nested Loops

1. **Understanding Loops**: Loops are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. In this case, we are using a `FOR` loop, which is ideal for a known number of iterations.

2. **Nested Loops**: A nested loop occurs when a loop exists inside another loop. The inner loop runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop. This is useful for tasks that require multiple levels of iteration.

3. **Exit Conditions**: Implementing exit conditions (like flags) is crucial in nested loops, especially to prevent infinite loops or unnecessary iterations. The `EXIT` statement can be used to break out of the loop when a specific condition is met.

4. **Counting Iterations**: When tracking how many times a loop has executed, declare a counter variable. Increment this counter within the loop and implement checks to ensure it does not exceed defined limits.

5. **Error Handling**: Always account for edge cases, such as exceeding the maximum count. Implement logic to handle such scenarios gracefully, such as resetting the count or capping it.

By following these principles, you can effectively design and implement nested loops in structured text for PLC programming.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

# Problem: The problem involves creating a function block (FB) in Structured Text (ST) for a programmable logic controller (PLC). The FB must include two nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from 0 to 10, and the inner loop iterates from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. Additionally, the design should include a flag to exit the loops early, and a count variable to track the number of times the inner loop executes without exceeding a defined maximum.

# Planning: 
1. Define the function block `FB_NestedLoopControl` with the following variables:
   - `i : INT;` for the outer loop index.
   - `j : INT;` for the inner loop index.
   - `flag : BOOL;` to control early exit from the loops.
   - `count : INT := 0;` to track iterations of the inner loop.
   - `some_var : INT;` for any additional variable if needed.
   
2. Implement the outer loop using `FOR i := 0 TO 10 DO`.

3. Within the outer loop, implement the inner loop using `FOR j := 10 TO 100 BY 2 DO`.

4. Inside the inner loop, add a conditional check `IF flag THEN EXIT;` to exit if the flag is TRUE.

5. Increment the count variable with `count := count + 1;` during each iteration of the inner loop.

6. Implement a check `IF count > 100 THEN` to ensure the count does not exceed the defined maximum.

7. If the maximum is reached, handle the case appropriately by capping the count with `count := 100;` and `EXIT;`.

8. End both loops correctly with `END_FOR` statements and ensure proper termination of the function block with `END_FUNCTION_BLOCK`.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The algorithm to be used here can be categorized as a combination of iterative control (for loops) and conditional checks. The loops are structured in a nested manner, where the inner loop is dependent on the outer loop's index.

## Problem to be solved: The problem involves creating a function block (FB) in Structured Text (ST) for a programmable logic controller (PLC). The FB must include two nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from 0 to 10, and the inner loop iterates from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. Additionally, the design should include a flag to exit the loops early, and a count variable to track the number of times the inner loop executes without exceeding a defined maximum.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
Sample Input: 
- `flag` set to FALSE initially.
- `count` should start at 0.

Sample Output:
- The `count` variable should reflect the number of times the inner loop executed, capped at 100.

        [ErrorInfo]
            The ST code has multiple syntax errors related to the use of `VAR_INPUT` and `END_VAR_INPUT` keywords and the 'VAR' declaration.

        [ErrorDescription]
            The ST code failed to compile due to incorrect usage of variable declaration sections. The `VAR_INPUT` section is incorrectly declared and thus causes missing expected tokens in the code.

        [ErrorReason]
            The `VAR_INPUT` section should not be used directly in the FUNCTION_BLOCK without specifying the context correctly. Instead, the input variables should be declared within a single `VAR` block or clearly separate the `VAR_INPUT` section.

        [FixingAdvice]
            - Declare the `flag` variable inside the `VAR` section or move the `VAR_INPUT` declaration correctly outside the `VAR` context.
            - Ensure that all variable declarations do not mix input and other variable types without clear structure. Here’s a corrected version of the code:

```structured-text

END_VAR_INPUT

    count : INT := 0; (* Count of inner loop iterations *)
    some_var : INT;   (* Additional variable if needed *)
END_VAR

(* Outer loop iterates from 0 to 10 *)
FOR i := 0 TO 10 DO
    (* Inner loop iterates from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2 *)
    FOR j := 10 TO 100 BY 2 DO
        
        (* Check if the exit flag is set *)
        IF flag THEN 
            EXIT;  (* Exit both loops if flag is TRUE *)
        END_IF
        
        (* Increment the count variable *)
        count := count + 1;
        
        (* Check if the count exceeds the defined maximum *)
        IF count > 100 THEN
            count := 100;  (* Cap the count at 100 *)
            EXIT;          (* Exit both loops if maximum is reached *)
        END_IF
        
    END_FOR;  (* End of inner loop *)
    
END_FOR;  (* End of outer loop *)

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```
            - Ensure no usage of the `BEGIN` keyword as it is not allowed in ST code.
