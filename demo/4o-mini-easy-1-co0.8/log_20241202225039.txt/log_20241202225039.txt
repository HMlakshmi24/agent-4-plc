<problem>
<description>
The problem involves creating a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) that simulates the behavior of a boolean NOT gate. The function block should take a boolean input and produce a boolean output that is the logical negation of the input.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK NOT_GATE
  VAR_INPUT
    Input : BOOL;
  END_VAR
  VAR_OUTPUT
    NegatedOutput : BOOL;
  END_VAR
  
  NegatedOutput := NOT Input;  // Logical negation of the input
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define a function block named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare an input variable of type BOOL named Input.
3. Declare an output variable of type BOOL named NegatedOutput.
4. Implement the negation operation by assigning the NOT of Input to NegatedOutput.
5. End the function block definition.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm that needs to be used to solve the original problem is straightforward, as it deals with a simple logical operation. The relevant algorithm for this problem is the **Logical Operation**.

**Tutorial on Logical Operations:**
1. **Understanding Logical Operations**: Logical operations are fundamental operations that manipulate boolean values. The basic operations are AND, OR, and NOT. Each operation returns a boolean result based on the input values.
  
2. **NOT Operation**: The NOT operation is a unary operation that takes a single boolean input and returns the opposite boolean value. If the input is TRUE, the NOT operation returns FALSE, and vice versa.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a function block or a method where you want to implement the logical operation.
   - Create the necessary input and output variables, ensuring they are of type BOOL.
   - Use the NOT operator to perform the negation on the input, assigning the result to the output variable.
   - Complete the function block or method definition, ensuring proper syntax and structure according to the programming language specifications.

4. **Testing**: After implementation, test the function block with various boolean inputs to ensure the output is as expected. For example, if the input is TRUE, the output should be FALSE, and if the input is FALSE, the output should be TRUE.
