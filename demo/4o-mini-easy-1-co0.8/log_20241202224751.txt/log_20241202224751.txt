<description>
The problem is to design a PLC program in Structured Text (ST) that contains a subroutine called 'constantprogram'. This subroutine takes an integer input and assigns this value to four intermediate variables (a, b, c, d0) sequentially. Finally, it assigns the value of d0 to the output variable 'o'. The main program 'MAIN' is responsible for calling the subroutine and passing the integer value of 3.

VAR

// Subroutine to assign values
a := i;              // Assign input to a

<planning>
1. Define a function block named FB_SequentialAssignment.
2. Declare input, output, and intermediate variables.
3. Implement the logic to assign the input value to the intermediate variables sequentially.
4. Assign the final value of the last variable to the output variable.
5. Ensure the function block can be called from the main program to test its functionality.
</planning>
</problem>
<algorithm>
The algorithm used in this problem is a simple Sequential Execution. This means that operations are performed one after another in a defined order. 

**Tutorial on Sequential Execution:**
1. **Definition**: Sequential execution refers to the process of executing a series of operations in a specific order. Each operation must complete before the next one begins.
   
2. **Use Cases**: This approach is commonly used in programming when the output of one operation depends on the result of a previous operation, such as in variable assignments.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define your input and output variables.
   - Create intermediate variables if necessary.
   - Write the operations in the order they should be executed.
   - Make sure that each operation is complete before moving on to the next one.
   - Use comments to clarify each step for future reference and maintenance.

4. **Example**:
   - Start with an input value.
   - Perform a series of assignments or calculations.
   - Store the final result in an output variable.

5. **Benefits**: The main advantage of sequential execution is its simplicity and ease of understanding, making it ideal for straightforward tasks where the order of operations is critical.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

# Problem: The problem is to design a PLC program in Structured Text (ST) that contains a subroutine called 'constantprogram'. This subroutine takes an integer input and assigns this value to four intermediate variables (a, b, c, d0) sequentially. Finally, it assigns the value of d0 to the output variable 'o'. The main program 'MAIN' is responsible for calling the subroutine and passing the integer value of 3.
# Planning: 
1. Define a function block named `FB_SequentialAssignment` in the Structured Text language.
2. Declare the following variables within the function block:
   - Input variable `i` of type `INT`.
   - Intermediate variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d0` of type `INT`.
   - Output variable `o` of type `INT`.
3. Implement the sequential logic in the function block:
   - Assign the input value `i` to the variable `a`.
   - Assign the value of `a` to the variable `b`.
   - Assign the value of `b` to the variable `c`.
   - Assign the value of `c` to the variable `d0`.
   - Assign the value of `d0` to the output variable `o`.
4. Create a main program `MAIN` that instantiates the function block and calls it, passing the integer value of `3` as the input.
5. Test the implementation by observing the output variable `o` after the function block execution to ensure it correctly reflects the expected value.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
The algorithm used in this problem is a simple Sequential Execution. This means that operations are performed one after another in a defined order.

## Problem to be solved: The problem is to design a PLC program in Structured Text (ST) that contains a subroutine called 'constantprogram'. This subroutine takes an integer input and assigns this value to four intermediate variables (a, b, c, d0) sequentially. Finally, it assigns the value of d0 to the output variable 'o'. The main program 'MAIN' is responsible for calling the subroutine and passing the integer value of 3.
