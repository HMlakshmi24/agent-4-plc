<description>
The problem is to implement a simple boolean AND gate in Structured Text (ST) programming language. The function block should take two boolean inputs and produce a boolean output that is TRUE only when both inputs are TRUE.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK AND_GATE
VAR_INPUT
Input1 : BOOL;
Input2 : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
AndResult : BOOL;
END_VAR
AndResult := Input1 AND Input2;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define a function block named AND_GATE.
2. Declare two input variables, Input1 and Input2, of type BOOL.
3. Declare one output variable, AndResult, of type BOOL.
4. Implement the logic for the AND operation by assigning the result of Input1 AND Input2 to AndResult.
5. Ensure the function block can be called with different boolean inputs to test its functionality.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve this problem is straightforward and based on basic boolean logic. The AND operation is a simple logical operation that follows these rules:
- TRUE AND TRUE = TRUE
- TRUE AND FALSE = FALSE
- FALSE AND TRUE = FALSE
- FALSE AND FALSE = FALSE

### Tutorial on Boolean Logic:
1. **Understanding Boolean Variables**: Boolean variables can only hold two values: TRUE or FALSE. Understanding how these values interact is crucial for implementing logical operations.
2. **AND Operation**: The AND operation outputs TRUE only if both operands are TRUE. This is the fundamental concept behind the AND gate.
3. **Implementing Logic in ST**: In Structured Text, logical operations can be performed using symbols such as AND, OR, NOT, etc. The AND operator is represented by the keyword 'AND'.
4. **Function Block Structure**: In ST, a function block is defined with the FUNCTION_BLOCK keyword, followed by the block name. Inputs and outputs are declared using VAR_INPUT and VAR_OUTPUT. The logic is then implemented within the block.
5. **Testing the Function Block**: After implementing the function block, it can be tested by calling it from a main program or another function block, passing different boolean values to ensure it behaves as expected.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
Input: Input1 = TRUE, Input2 = TRUE -> Output: AndResult = TRUE  
Input: Input1 = TRUE, Input2 = FALSE -> Output: AndResult = FALSE  
Input: Input1 = FALSE, Input2 = TRUE -> Output: AndResult = FALSE  
Input: Input1 = FALSE, Input2 = FALSE -> Output: AndResult = FALSE
