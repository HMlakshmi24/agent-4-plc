<problem>
<description>
The problem is to design a Function Block in Structured Text (ST) that takes an integer as input and returns an integer as output, while managing an internal state that increments with each execution of the block.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK dw
VAR_INPUT
    i: INT;
    ss: INT := 0; // Initialize ss to 0
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    o: INT;
END_VAR

// Logic to determine the output based on the input
o := 0; // Default output value
ss := ss + 1; // Increment internal state

IF i = 1 THEN
    o := 1; // Set output to 1 if input is 1
ELSE
    o := ss; // Otherwise, output the current value of ss
END_IF
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define a Function Block named 'dw' that contains input and output variables.
2. Initialize an internal variable 'ss' to keep track of the number of times the block is executed.
3. Implement logic to check if the input 'i' is equal to 1.
4. If 'i' equals 1, set the output 'o' to 1. If not, set 'o' to the current value of 'ss'.
5. Ensure 'ss' increments every time the block is executed.
6. Test the Function Block by calling it in a main program with an input value of 3.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve this problem is a simple state machine algorithm. 
This algorithm maintains a state (in this case, the variable 'ss') and updates it based on certain conditions (the value of input 'i'). 

Tutorial:
1. **State Initialization**: Start by defining any internal variables that will hold state information. In our case, 'ss' is initialized to 0.
2. **Input Processing**: Check the input value and decide the logic based on that input. This could include conditional statements.
3. **State Update**: Update the state variable after processing the input. This could involve incrementing a counter or changing a status flag.
4. **Output Assignment**: Based on the input and updated state, assign the appropriate value to the output variable.
5. **Execution Flow**: Ensure that the function block can be executed multiple times, maintaining the state across those executions.

This algorithm is effective for problems where you need to keep track of internal states and respond differently based on input conditions.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

# Problem: The problem is to design a Function Block in Structured Text (ST) that takes an integer as input and returns an integer as output, while managing an internal state that increments with each execution of the block.
# Planning: 
1. Define a Function Block named 'dw' that contains input and output variables.
2. Declare an internal variable 'ss' of type INT and initialize it to 0 to keep track of the number of times the block is executed.
3. Implement logic to check if the input variable 'i' is equal to 1.
4. If 'i' equals 1, assign the output variable 'o' the value of 1. If 'i' is not equal to 1, assign 'o' the current value of 'ss'.
5. Ensure that 'ss' is incremented by 1 every time the block is executed to maintain the execution count.
6. Create a test program to call the Function Block with various input values, specifically testing with an input value of 3 to verify that the output is as expected.
7. Validate the functionality by running multiple test cases to ensure the internal state 'ss' behaves as intended across different executions of the block.
## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: 1, Output: 1
- Input: 3, Output: 2 (after first execution), Output: 3 (after second execution)
