<description>
The problem involves creating a Function Block (FB) in Structured Text (ST) for a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) that monitors a start/stop signal. The FB should detect a rising edge in the input signal and manage the state of an output variable based on that detection.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_MonitorStartStop
VAR_INPUT
    Start_Stop  : BOOL;  // Input: Start/Stop signal
    ON_OFF      : BOOL;   // Input: Current ON/OFF state
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    ONS_Trig    : BOOL;   // Output: One-shot trigger for rising edge
    Rising_ONS  : BOOL;    // Output: Previous state of Start_Stop
END_VAR

VAR
    // Internal variable to hold the previous state
    Prev_State : BOOL; 
END_VAR

// Main logic
Prev_State := Rising_ONS; // Store previous state in internal variable
Rising_ONS := Start_Stop; // Update Rising_ONS to current Start_Stop

ONS_Trig := NOT Prev_State AND Rising_ONS; // Detect rising edge

// Update ON_OFF state based on the XOR operation with ONS_Trig
ON_OFF := ONS_Trig XOR ON_OFF;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the Function Block (FB) with necessary input and output variables.
2. Declare an internal variable to store the previous state of the Start_Stop input.
3. In the main logic section, update the Rising_ONS variable with the current value of Start_Stop.
4. Implement the rising edge detection logic using a logical expression.
5. Update the ON_OFF variable based on the XOR operation with the ONS_Trig output.
6. Ensure that the function block can be instantiated and tested within a PLC program.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used for this problem can be categorized as a State Machine approach. 

Tutorial: 
A state machine is a computational model that transitions between states based on inputs or events. In this case, the states are determined by the Start_Stop signal and the ON_OFF variable. The key steps in implementing a state machine include:

1. **Define States**: Identify the states you need (e.g., ON, OFF).
2. **Define Inputs**: Determine the inputs that will trigger state changes (in this case, the Start_Stop signal).
3. **Transition Logic**: Create conditions for transitioning between states. This can be done using logical expressions that evaluate the current state and input signals.
4. **Output Logic**: Based on the current state and inputs, define the outputs (e.g., setting ONS_Trig and updating ON_OFF).
5. **Implementation**: Use structured text or any appropriate programming language to implement the logic.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage state transitions and output conditions in your PLC programs.

2. Declare output variables `ONS_Trig` and `Rising_ONS` to manage the rising edge detection.
3. Introduce an internal variable `Prev_State` to hold the previous state of the `Start_Stop` input.
4. In the main logic section, assign the value of `Rising_ONS` to `Prev_State` to store the previous state.
5. Update `Rising_ONS` to hold the current value of `Start_Stop`.
6. Implement the rising edge detection logic using the expression `ONS_Trig := NOT Prev_State AND Rising_ONS`.

        [ErrorInfo]
            Compilation error at line 18 and 19 due to unresolved reference to 'Rising_ONS'.

        [ErrorDescription]
            The variable 'Rising_ONS' is being used without being declared. The code attempts to assign a value to 'Rising_ONS', which has not been defined in the function block.

        [ErrorReason]
            'Rising_ONS' is mentioned in the code but it is not declared anywhere in the function block. This results in the compiler being unable to resolve references to it.

        [FixingAdvice]
            Remove the reference to 'Rising_ONS' as it is not part of the defined variables. If the intention was to track the current state of 'Start_Stop', you can directly use 'Start_Stop' in the logic for 'ONS_Trig'. Here is a corrected version of the function block:

            ```structured-text
            FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_StartStopMonitor
            VAR_INPUT
                Start_Stop : BOOL;  // Input signal to monitor
                ON_OFF : BOOL;      // Current state of the output
            END_VAR

            VAR_OUTPUT
                ONS_Trig : BOOL;    // Rising edge trigger output
                Rising_ONS : BOOL;  // Store the current value of Start_Stop
            END_VAR

            VAR
                Prev_State : BOOL;  // Previous state of the Start_Stop input
            END_VAR

            (* Main logic for rising edge detection *)
            ONS_Trig := NOT Prev_State AND Start_Stop;  // Detect rising edge
            Rising_ONS := Start_Stop;   // Store current value of Start_Stop
            Prev_State := Start_Stop;  // Store the previous state

            (* Update ON_OFF state based on the rising edge trigger *)
            IF ONS_Trig THEN
                ON_OFF := NOT ON_OFF;  // Toggle ON_OFF state
            END_IF

            END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
            ```

            Make sure to declare 'Rising_ONS' in the VAR_OUTPUT section to prevent similar issues in the future.
