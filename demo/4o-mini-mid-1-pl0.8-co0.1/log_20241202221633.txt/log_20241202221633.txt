<description>
The problem involves designing a function block in Structured Text (ST) to control the state of an LED and the direction of a motor based on button inputs. The function block should handle two buttons: one for left control and one for right control, and it should activate the corresponding LED and motor direction based on the button presses.

</code>
<planning>
1. Define the function block with input and output variables.
2. Implement the logic to control the LED states based on the given signals (E_Left and E_Right).
3. Implement the logic to control the motor direction based on the button states (PI_Button_Left and PI_Button_Right).
4. Ensure that the function block updates the outputs (LED and motor) as needed based on the input conditions.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve this problem can be categorized as a simple Conditional Logic approach. 
In this case, we utilize conditional statements to determine the states of the LEDs and motor based on the button inputs. 

Tutorial:
1. **Understanding Inputs and Outputs**: Clearly define what inputs the function block will receive (buttons and signals) and what outputs it will control (LEDs and motor directions).
  
2. **Implementing Logic**: Use conditional statements to set the outputs based on the inputs. For instance, use `IF` statements or logical operations to determine if the LEDs should be turned on or off based on the signals.

3. **Testing Conditions**: Ensure that the logic accounts for all possible states of the inputs. For example, check how the motor behaves when both buttons are pressed or not pressed at all.

4. **Finalizing the Function Block**: Once the logic is implemented and tested, encapsulate it within the function block structure to maintain modularity and reusability in your program.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

# Problem: The problem involves designing a function block in Structured Text (ST) to control the state of an LED and the direction of a motor based on button inputs. The function block should handle two buttons: one for left control and one for right control, and it should activate the corresponding LED and motor direction based on the button presses.
# Planning: 
1. Define the function block `LED_Motor_Controller` with input variables `PI_Button_Left`, `PI_Button_Right`, `E_Left`, and `E_Right`.
2. Define output variables `PI_LED_Red`, `PI_LED_Green`, `A_Motor_Left`, and `A_Motor_Right`.
3. Implement the logic to control the LED states:
   - Set `PI_LED_Red` to `E_Left` (turn on red LED if `E_Left` is TRUE).
   - Set `PI_LED_Green` to `E_Right` (turn on green LED if `E_Right` is TRUE).
4. Implement the logic to control the motor direction:
   - Set `A_Motor_Left` to `NOT PI_Button_Left` (motor turns left when the left button is not pressed).
   - Set `A_Motor_Right` to `NOT PI_Button_Right` (motor turns right when the right button is not pressed).
5. Ensure correct updates to outputs based on the current states of inputs.
6. Test the function block under various input conditions to validate the expected behavior of LEDs and motors.
