<description>
The problem involves creating a PLC program using Structured Text (ST) to calculate the Fibonacci number up to a given integer input value NN. The program must handle cases where the output exceeds the maximum value for an integer (32767) and return this maximum value instead, using saturation arithmetic. Additionally, it must correctly handle edge cases for NN values less than or equal to 2 by returning 1.

<planning>
1. Define the function block FB_Fibonacci_Calculator with input N and output O.
2. Initialize variables F1 and F2 to store the first two Fibonacci numbers, and a counter CNT to track the current position in the sequence.
3. Implement a conditional check to handle edge cases when N is less than or equal to 2, returning 1 directly.
4. Use a WHILE loop to calculate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until CNT reaches N.
5. In each iteration, calculate the next Fibonacci number and check if it exceeds 32767. If it does, set O to 32767 and exit the function.
6. After the loop, assign the last calculated Fibonacci number to O to return the result.

<algorithm>
The algorithm to be used for this problem is the Iterative approach (Dynamic Programming). 

Tutorial for Dynamic Programming:
Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful for problems that exhibit overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

1. **Identify Subproblems**: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. In the case of Fibonacci, the nth Fibonacci number can be found using the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.
  
2. **Memoization**: Store the results of previously computed subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. This can be done using arrays or hash maps.

3. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Start solving the smallest subproblems first and use their solutions to build up to the solution of the original problem.

4. **Saturation Arithmetic**: Implement checks to ensure that values do not exceed predefined limits (like 32767) and handle those cases accordingly, typically by returning the maximum allowable value.

5. **Complexity**: Assess the time and space complexity of the DP approach. For Fibonacci, the time complexity is O(N) and space complexity can be optimized to O(1) by only storing the last two Fibonacci numbers at any time.

By utilizing Dynamic Programming, you can efficiently compute values in a sequence while avoiding unnecessary recalculations.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

# Problem: The problem involves creating a PLC program using Structured Text (ST) to calculate the Fibonacci number up to a given integer input value NN. The program must handle cases where the output exceeds the maximum value for an integer (32767) and return this maximum value instead, using saturation arithmetic. Additionally, it must correctly handle edge cases for NN values less than or equal to 2 by returning 1.

# Planning:
1. Define the function block `FB_Fibonacci_Calculator` with input `N` and output `O`.
2. Initialize variables `F1` and `F2` to store the first two Fibonacci numbers, and a counter `CNT` to track the current position in the sequence.
3. Implement a conditional check to handle edge cases when `N` is less than or equal to 2, setting `O` to 1 and returning directly.
4. Use a `WHILE` loop to calculate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until `CNT` reaches `N`.
5. In each iteration, calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding `F1` and `F2`, and check if it exceeds 32767. If it does, set `O` to 32767 and exit the function.
6. After the loop, assign the last calculated Fibonacci number to `O` to return the result.
