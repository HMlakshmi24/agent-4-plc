# Design a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST) to monitor start/stop signals and manage trigger and rising edge signals. The function block should set 'ONS_Trig' to 'TRUE' when 'Start_Stop' changes from 'FALSE' to 'TRUE', update 'ON_OFF' based on the XOR of 'ONS_Trig' and 'ON_OFF', and store the current value of 'Start_Stop' in 'Rising_ONS' to detect changes in the next PLC cycle.

# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Define a function block `FB_MonitorStartStop` with input, output, and internal variables.
2. Implement logic to detect the rising edge of `Start_Stop` and set `ONS_Trig`.
3. Use the XOR operation logic to update `ON_OFF`.
4. Store the current value of `Start_Stop` in `Prev_Start_Stop` for detecting changes in the next cycle.

<algorithm>
# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.

The problem involves detecting the rising edge of a signal, which is a common task in digital signal processing and control systems. The approach used here can be described as a "state memory" algorithm, where the previous state of the signal is stored to detect changes.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

## Tutorial on State Memory Algorithm:

### Purpose:
The state memory algorithm is used for tasks that require detection of changes in the state of a signal, particularly to detect transitions such as rising or falling edges.

### Concept:
1. **State Storage**: Store the state of a signal from the last cycle or iteration.
2. **State Comparison**: Compare the current state of the signal with the stored state to detect changes.
3. **Edge Detection**: For rising edge detection, check if the signal changed from FALSE to TRUE.
4. **State Update**: Update the stored state with the current state for use in the next cycle.

### Application:
- **Rising Edge Detection**: Useful in scenarios where actions need to be triggered on the transition from low to high signal.
- **Falling Edge Detection**: Similarly, it can be adapted to detect a high to low transition.

### Example Use Cases:
- Start/stop buttons in control panels.
- Trigger events in automation systems.
- Pulse generation in digital circuits.

### Implementation:
- Typically involves a simple logical comparison and updating a state variable.
- Efficient in terms of computation and memory usage, as it requires minimal operations.

By implementing this algorithm, systems can effectively respond to precise changes in signal states, enabling accurate control and automation processes.

## Problem to be solved: 
Design a PLC function block using Structured Text (ST) to monitor start/stop signals and manage trigger and rising edge signals. The function block should set 'ONS_Trig' to 'TRUE' when 'Start_Stop' changes from 'FALSE' to 'TRUE', update 'ON_OFF' based on the XOR of 'ONS_Trig' and 'ON_OFF', and store the current value of 'Start_Stop' in 'Rising_ONS' to detect changes in the next PLC cycle.
