# Design a PLC program using structured text (ST code) to implement a function block that calculates the Fibonacci number for a given integer input N. The program should handle saturation, returning a maximum value of 32767 if the Fibonacci number exceeds this limit. The main program should initialize an integer input value N (default is 5) and calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the N-th term, handling edge cases where N is less than or equal to 2 by returning 1.

# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Initialize the input and output variables, setting the default value for N and handling basic edge cases.
2. Use a FOR loop to iterate through the Fibonacci sequence until reaching the N-th term.
3. Check each calculated Fibonacci number against the saturation limit (32767) to ensure it does not exceed it.
4. If the Fibonacci number exceeds the limit, set the output to 32767 and exit the loop.
5. Update the previous Fibonacci numbers for the next iteration.
6. Return the N-th Fibonacci number as the output.

# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
The algorithm used in the provided solution can be identified as an iterative approach, which is a type of Brute-force algorithm. It calculates Fibonacci numbers sequentially, one by one, until the desired N-th term is reached.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this type of problem. Do not generate code.

Iterative Approach (Brute-force) for Fibonacci Sequence:
The iterative approach to calculating Fibonacci numbers involves using a simple loop to calculate each term in the sequence up to the desired N-th term. This method is straightforward and efficient for small values of N, as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls.

Key Steps:
1. Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers (usually F1 = 1 and F2 = 1).
2. Use a loop to iterate through the sequence, starting from the third term up to N.
3. In each iteration, calculate the next Fibonacci number by summing the two previous numbers.
4. Update the two previous numbers for the next iteration.
5. If the calculated Fibonacci number exceeds a predefined saturation limit, handle it according to the requirements (e.g., set it to the maximum allowed value).
6. Return the N-th Fibonacci number.

This approach is effective for sequences where each term is defined based on previous terms, ensuring simplicity and clarity in implementation.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next 
problem:
Iterative Approach (Brute-force) for Fibonacci Sequence

## Problem to be solved: 
Design a PLC program using structured text (ST code) to implement a function block that calculates the Fibonacci number for a given integer input N. The program should handle saturation, returning a maximum value of 32767 if the Fibonacci number exceeds this limit. The main program should initialize an integer input value N (default is 5) and calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the N-th term, handling edge cases where N is less than or equal to 2 by returning 1.

## Planning:
1. Initialize the input variable `N` with a default value of 5 and output variable `O` to store the Fibonacci number, handling edge cases where `N <= 2` by setting `O` to 1.
2. Prepare two variables `F1` and `F2`, both initialized to 1, to represent the first two Fibonacci numbers.
3. Set up a counter `CNT` starting from 3 to iterate through the Fibonacci sequence up to the N-th term.
4. Implement a FOR loop that runs from 3 to `N`.
5. Inside the loop, compute the next Fibonacci number by summing `F1` and `F2` and assign it to `O`.
6. Check if `O` exceeds the saturation limit of 32767. If it does, set `O` to 32767 and break out of the loop.
7. Update `F1` and `F2` for the next iteration: `F1` becomes `F2`, and `F2` becomes the current value of `O`.
8. After the loop, return `O` which now holds the N-th Fibonacci number or 32767 if saturation occurred.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: N = 5, Output: 5
- Input: N = 10, Output: 55
- Input: N = 20, Output: 6765
- Input: N = 30, Output: 32767 (saturation limit reached)
