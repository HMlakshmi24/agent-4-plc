# Design a function block in Structured Text (ST) for controlling an LED and motor based on button inputs. The block should handle input variables for left and right button presses, and output variables for controlling a red LED, green LED, and motor direction. Specifically, the red LED should activate when a left signal is received, the green LED for a right signal, and the motor should run left when the left button is not pressed and right when the right button is not pressed.

# Planning to solve this problem:
1. Define the input variables for left and right button presses and signals for LED activation.
2. Define the output variables for controlling the red and green LEDs, as well as the motor direction.
3. Implement logic to activate the red LED when the left signal is received and the green LED when the right signal is received.
4. Implement logic to control motor direction: the motor should run left when the left button is not pressed and right when the right button is not pressed.
5. Ensure that the output states are updated accordingly based on the input conditions.

<algorithm>
# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.

The logic for controlling LEDs and motor direction based on input signals is a simple decision-making process that can be categorized as a "Rule-based" or "Conditional" logic algorithm. It involves straightforward conditional statements to determine the output states based on the input conditions.

# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.

A rule-based or conditional logic algorithm is one of the simplest forms of decision-making processes used in programming. It involves using conditional statements (if-else) to execute specific actions based on certain conditions. Here is a high-level tutorial for solving problems using rule-based logic:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: Clearly define the inputs, outputs, and the conditions under which different outputs should be activated.

2. **Identify Input and Output Variables**: Determine what variables will serve as inputs to your logic and what outputs need to be controlled based on these inputs.

3. **Establish Conditions**: Define the conditions under which each output should be activated or deactivated. This involves understanding the logical relationships between inputs and outputs.

4. **Implement Conditional Logic**: Use conditional statements to check the conditions and manipulate the outputs accordingly. Each condition should be checked, and based on its result, the corresponding action should be taken.

5. **Test the Logic**: Once implemented, it's essential to test the logic with various input scenarios to ensure that it behaves as expected and meets all the specified requirements.

This approach is commonly used in control systems, decision-making algorithms, and situations where a specific set of rules define the behavior of a system based on its inputs.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:
Rule-based or Conditional Logic Algorithm

## Problem to be solved:
Design a function block in Structured Text (ST) for controlling an LED and motor based on button inputs. The block should handle input variables for left and right button presses, and output variables for controlling a red LED, green LED, and motor direction. Specifically, the red LED should activate when a left signal is received, the green LED for a right signal, and the motor should run left when the left button is not pressed and right when the right button is not pressed.

## Planning:
1. Define the input variables:
   - `PI_Button_Left`: Boolean input for the left button.
   - `PI_Button_Right`: Boolean input for the right button.
   - `E_Left`: Boolean signal for activating the red LED.
   - `E_Right`: Boolean signal for activating the green LED.

2. Define the output variables:
   - `PI_LED_Red`: Boolean output to control the red LED.
   - `PI_LED_Green`: Boolean output to control the green LED.
   - `A_Motor_Left`: Boolean output to run the motor left.
   - `A_Motor_Right`: Boolean output to run the motor right.

3. Implement logic to control the LEDs:
   - Activate `PI_LED_Red` if `E_Left` is TRUE.
   - Activate `PI_LED_Green` if `E_Right` is TRUE.

4. Implement logic to control the motor direction:
   - Set `A_Motor_Left` to TRUE and `A_Motor_Right` to FALSE if `PI_Button_Left` is NOT pressed.
   - Set `A_Motor_Right` to TRUE and `A_Motor_Left` to FALSE if `PI_Button_Right` is NOT pressed.

5. Ensure the outputs are updated based on the input conditions.

## Sample Input/Outputs:
- Input: `PI_Button_Left = FALSE`, `PI_Button_Right = TRUE`, `E_Left = TRUE`, `E_Right = FALSE`
  - Output: `PI_LED_Red = TRUE`, `PI_LED_Green = FALSE`, `A_Motor_Left = TRUE`, `A_Motor_Right = FALSE`

- Input: `PI_Button_Left = TRUE`, `PI_Button_Right = FALSE`, `E_Left = FALSE`, `E_Right = TRUE`
  - Output: `PI_LED_Red = FALSE`, `PI_LED_Green = TRUE`, `A_Motor_Left = FALSE`, `A_Motor_Right = TRUE`
