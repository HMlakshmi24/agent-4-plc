<description>
Design a function block in Structured Text (ST) for a PLC named LatencyMonitor. This block monitors the latency of a specific node by updating error counts and tracking minimum and maximum latency values based on input conditions. The function block has two input variables: `latency_xx_ms` (latency time in milliseconds) and `NODE_xx_STATUS` (current status of the node). It also has four IN_OUT variables: `errors_xx` (counts errors for the specific node), `errors_all` (total error count), `min_latency_ms` (minimum observed latency), and `max_latency_ms` (maximum observed latency).

Implement the logic within the function block as follows:
1. If `latency_xx_ms` is zero or if `NODE_xx_STATUS` is not equal to 1, increment both `errors_xx` and `errors_all`.
2. Update `min_latency_ms` if `latency_xx_ms` is less than the current minimum or if the current minimum is negative.
3. Update `max_latency_ms` if `latency_xx_ms` is greater than the current maximum or if the current maximum is negative.

<planning>
1. Define input and IN_OUT variables for the function block.
2. Implement a check to update error counts when latency is zero or node status is not equal to 1.
3. Use conditional checks to update minimum and maximum latency values based on input conditions.
4. Ensure that the function block updates error counts and latency values each time it is called.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
To solve the original problem, we can use a straightforward conditional logic algorithm. This involves checking conditions and updating values based on these conditions, which is a simple form of control structure common in programming.

Tutorial:
1. Conditional Logic: This algorithm involves checking certain conditions (e.g., if a value equals zero or if a status is not equal to a desired state) and executing specific actions when these conditions are met. This is done through the use of IF statements.

2. State Tracking: The algorithm needs to keep track of the state of certain variables (e.g., error counts and latency values). This involves updating these variables based on the logic defined in the conditions.

3. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as initial negative values for latency, which should be updated immediately when a valid positive latency is received.

4. Efficiency: Ensure that the function block efficiently updates values without unnecessary calculations or operations, allowing it to run effectively within a PLC environment.

These principles can be applied to any similar problem involving monitoring and updating based on input conditions.

This block monitors the latency of a specific node by updating error counts and tracking minimum and maximum latency values based on input conditions. The function block has two input variables: `latency_xx_ms` (latency time in milliseconds) and `NODE_xx_STATUS` (current status of the node).

- Sample Output: `errors_xx` = 1, `errors_all` = 1, `min_latency_ms` = 10, `max_latency_ms` = 10

- Sample Input: `latency_xx_ms` = 0, `NODE_xx_STATUS` = 1, `errors_xx` = 1, `errors_all` = 1, `min_latency_ms` = 10, `max_latency_ms` = 10
- Sample Output: `errors_xx` = 2, `errors_all` = 2, `min_latency_ms` = 10, `max_latency_ms` = 10
