<description>
The problem involves creating a function block (FB) in structured text (ST) for a PLC program. The FB must include two nested loops, an outer loop iterating from 0 to 10 and an inner loop iterating from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. Additionally, if a flag is set to TRUE, the loops should exit, and we must maintain a count of how many times the inner loop executed, ensuring this count does not exceed a defined maximum.

<planning>
1. Define the function block with necessary variables (i, j, flag, count, some_var).
2. Implement the outer loop iterating from 0 to 10.
3. Within the outer loop, implement the inner loop from 10 to 100 with a step of 2.
4. Check the flag at each iteration of the inner loop; if TRUE, exit the loop.
5. Increment the count variable for each inner loop execution.
6. Implement a condition to cap the count variable if it exceeds the maximum allowed iterations.
7. Ensure all variables remain within their defined bounds during execution.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm suitable for this problem is a nested loop structure, which is a fundamental programming construct used to perform repetitive tasks. In this case, the outer loop controls the number of iterations for the outer task, while the inner loop performs a secondary repetitive task.

Tutorial:
1. **Understanding Nested Loops**: Nested loops are loops within loops. The outer loop initiates the inner loop each time it iterates. This structure is useful when you need to perform a series of operations multiple times.

2. **Defining Loop Bounds**: Clearly define the start and end conditions for both loops. Ensure that the loop variables are initialized properly and that they update as expected.

3. **Exiting Loops**: You can use a flag to control the execution flow. If a condition is met (like the flag being TRUE), you can utilize the EXIT command to break out of the inner loop.

4. **Counting Iterations**: Maintain a count of the number of iterations executed by the inner loop. This may involve checking and capping the count against a maximum limit to prevent overflow.

5. **Validation of Variables**: Always validate the loop variables and count against their defined bounds to ensure the integrity of the loop execution.

6. **Efficiency Considerations**: Be mindful of the performance implications of nested loops, especially if the outer and inner loop ranges are large. Consider optimizing the logic if necessary.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

# Problem: The problem involves creating a function block (FB) in structured text (ST) for a PLC program. The FB must include two nested loops, an outer loop iterating from 0 to 10 and an inner loop iterating from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. Additionally, if a flag is set to TRUE, the loops should exit, and we must maintain a count of how many times the inner loop executed, ensuring this count does not exceed a defined maximum.

# Planning: 
1. Define the function block header `FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_NestedLoopControl`.
2. Declare the necessary variables: 
   - `i : INT;` for the outer loop index.
   - `j : INT;` for the inner loop index.
   - `flag : BOOL;` to control the exit condition.
   - `count : INT := 0;` to count inner loop executions.
   - `some_var : INT;` (if needed for additional logic).
3. Start the outer loop with `FOR i := 0 TO 10 DO`.
4. Inside the outer loop, start the inner loop with `FOR j := 10 TO 100 BY 2 DO`.
5. Within the inner loop, check if `flag` is TRUE. If so, use `EXIT;` to terminate the inner loop.
6. Increment `count` by 1 for each iteration of the inner loop using `count := count + 1;`.
7. Implement a condition to ensure `count` does not exceed a defined maximum (e.g., `IF count > 46 THEN count := 46; EXIT;`).
8. End the inner loop with `END_FOR`.
9. End the outer loop with `END_FOR`.
10. Conclude the function block with `END_FUNCTION_BLOCK`.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next 
problem:
The algorithm suitable for this problem is a nested loop structure, which is a fundamental programming construct used to perform repetitive tasks.

## Problem to be solved: The problem involves creating a function block (FB) in structured text (ST) for a PLC program. The FB must include two nested loops, an outer loop iterating from 0 to 10 and an inner loop iterating from 10 to 100 with a step size of 2. Additionally, if a flag is set to TRUE, the loops should exit, and we must maintain a count of how many times the inner loop executed, ensuring this count does not exceed a defined maximum.

## Sample Input/Outputs: 
Input: 
- `flag = FALSE`
- `count = 0`
Output: 
- Executes inner loop iterations, count increments until the inner loop completes or `count` reaches maximum (46).

            END_VAR

        [ErrorInfo]
            The code fails to compile due to the incorrect usage of variable declaration sections. Specifically, the `END_VAR_INPUT` should not exist, and the `VAR` and `END_VAR` declarations are incorrectly positioned.

        [ErrorDescription]
            The ST compiler is reporting multiple syntax errors related to variable declarations and expected tokens.

        [ErrorReason]
            The use of `VAR_INPUT` is valid only for defining input variables in a function block, but it is improperly terminated with `END_VAR_INPUT`, which leads to parsing errors. Additionally, there is a misplaced `VAR` declaration that disrupts the expected syntax structure.

        [FixingAdvice]
            Remove the `VAR_INPUT` section completely since the `flag` variable can simply be defined in the `VAR` section. Replace it with a standard declaration within the `VAR` section. Also, ensure that the closing `END_VAR` matches the opening `VAR` declaration.
     
            The corrected code should look like the following:

            ```pascal
            FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_NestedLoopControl

                    IF flag THEN
                        EXIT;  (* Exit the inner loop if flag is TRUE *)
                    END_IF
                    
                    (* Increment the count for each iteration of the inner loop *)
                    count := count + 1;

                    (* Ensure count does not exceed the defined maximum *)
                    IF count > max_count THEN
                        count := max_count;  (* Cap the count at maximum *)
                        EXIT;  (* Exit the inner loop if maximum is reached *)
