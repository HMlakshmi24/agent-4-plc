<description>
The problem involves creating a function block in Structured Text (ST) programming that takes two integer inputs, compares them, and returns the larger value as an output. The function block needs to ensure that the maximum value is determined within a single PLC cycle.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK FIND_MAX_VALUE
VAR_INPUT
    Value1 : INT;
    Value2 : INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    MaxValue : INT;
END_VAR

BEGIN
    IF Value1 > Value2 THEN
        MaxValue := Value1;
    ELSE
        MaxValue := Value2;
    END_IF;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the function block named FIND_MAX_VALUE.
2. Declare input variables Value1 and Value2 of type INT.
3. Declare output variable MaxValue of type INT.
4. In the body of the function block, use an IF statement to compare Value1 and Value2.
5. Assign the larger of the two values to MaxValue.
6. End the function block.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve this problem is a simple comparison algorithm. 

Tutorial: 
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to compare two integer values and determine which one is larger. This is a common task in programming, often implemented via conditional statements.

2. **Using Conditional Statements**: The primary method to compare values in most programming languages is through conditional statements (like IF-THEN-ELSE). In this case, we check if Value1 is greater than Value2. If true, we assign Value1 to MaxValue; otherwise, we assign Value2.

3. **Single Cycle Execution**: To ensure that the comparison and assignment occur within a single cycle in the PLC, we need to write efficient and straightforward code without any loops or delays, ensuring that the function block can be executed quickly.

4. **Testing the Function Block**: It's important to test the function block with various combinations of input values to ensure it behaves correctly under all scenarios (e.g., equal values, negative values, etc.).

By following these steps and using the comparison algorithm, you can efficiently determine the maximum value between two integers in a PLC environment.
