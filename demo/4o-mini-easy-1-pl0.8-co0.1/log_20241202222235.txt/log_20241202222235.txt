<description>
The problem is to design a PLC function block named 'CALCULATE_OUTPUT' in structured text (ST) that takes an integer input 'i' and produces an output 'o' based on specific conditions. The output should be calculated as follows: if 'i' is 0, 'o' should be 0; if 'i' is between 1 and 5, 'o' should be the square of 'i'; if 'i' is between 6 and 10, 'o' should equal 'i' plus two times 'i'; otherwise, 'o' should be assigned a value of -1. The function block must also handle valid bounds for 'i' to ensure 'o' never takes undefined or invalid values.

<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_CalculateOutput
VAR_INPUT
    i: INT;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    o: INT;
END_VAR

BEGIN
    IF i = 0 THEN
        o := 0;
    ELSIF (i >= 1) AND (i <= 5) THEN
        o := i * i;  // Square of i
    ELSIF (i >= 6) AND (i <= 10) THEN
        o := i + 2 * i;  // i plus two times i
    ELSE
        o := -1;  // Invalid input
    END_IF;
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the function block 'FB_CalculateOutput' with input and output variables.
2. Set up a conditional structure to evaluate the input 'i'.
3. Implement the first condition to check if 'i' is 0 and assign 0 to 'o'.
4. Implement the second condition to check if 'i' is between 1 and 5 and assign the square of 'i' to 'o'.
5. Implement the third condition to check if 'i' is between 6 and 10 and assign 'i' plus two times 'i' to 'o'.
6. Implement the default condition to assign -1 to 'o' for any other value of 'i'.
7. Ensure the function block is properly tested to validate the output for various input scenarios.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used in this problem is conditional branching based on input value ranges. This is a simple control flow technique that allows the program to execute different code segments based on the conditions met by the input values.

Tutorial for Conditional Branching:
1. Conditional branching is a fundamental programming concept that allows you to execute different code based on whether a condition is true or false.
2. In structured text (ST), you typically use 'IF...THEN...ELSIF...ELSE' statements to define these conditions.
3. Start by evaluating the most specific condition first, which in this case is checking if the input is equal to a specific value (e.g., 0).
4. Next, check for ranges (e.g., using 'AND' to specify lower and upper bounds).
5. Ensure that all possible input scenarios are covered to avoid undefined behaviors.
6. Finally, test your function block with a variety of inputs to ensure it behaves as expected across all defined cases.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

# Problem: The problem is to design a PLC function block named 'CALCULATE_OUTPUT' in structured text (ST) that takes an integer input 'i' and produces an output 'o' based on specific conditions.

# Planning:
1. Define the function block 'FB_CalculateOutput' with input variable 'i' of type INT and output variable 'o' of type INT.
2. Set up the main structure of the function block using the BEGIN...END keywords.
3. Implement a conditional structure using IF...THEN...ELSIF...ELSE statements to evaluate the input 'i'.
4. Check if 'i' is equal to 0; if true, assign 0 to output 'o'.
5. For the next condition, check if 'i' is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), and if true, assign the square of 'i' (i * i) to output 'o'.
6. Check if 'i' is between 6 and 10 (inclusive); if true, assign 'i' plus two times 'i' (i + 2 * i) to output 'o'.
7. Implement a default case using ELSE to assign -1 to output 'o' for any value of 'i' outside the specified ranges.
8. Add comments for clarity and maintainability within the code, explaining the purpose of each condition.
9. Conduct unit testing to ensure that all conditions are handled correctly, covering edge cases such as inputs of 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, and values outside the defined ranges.
10. Document the function block behavior, input-output relationships, and test results for future reference.

## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:

- Input: i = 2; Output: o = 4
- Input: i = 7; Output: o = 21
- Input: i = 11; Output: o = -1
