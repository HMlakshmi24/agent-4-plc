<description>
The problem is to implement a boolean NOT gate using a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST). The function block should take one boolean input and produce one boolean output, where the output is the logical negation of the input.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK NOT_GATE
VAR_INPUT
    Input : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    NegatedOutput : BOOL;
END_VAR

NegatedOutput := NOT Input;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define a function block named NOT_GATE.
2. Declare an input variable named Input of type BOOL.
3. Declare an output variable named NegatedOutput of type BOOL.
4. Implement the logic for negation using the NOT operator.
5. Terminate the function block.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve this problem is straightforward and does not require complex techniques. The logical negation can be implemented directly using the NOT operator.

Tutorial:
1. **Understanding Boolean Logic**: A NOT gate is a fundamental building block in digital electronics. It takes an input and outputs the opposite value. For example, if the input is TRUE (or 1), the output will be FALSE (or 0), and vice versa.

2. **Structured Text (ST) Basics**: ST is a high-level programming language used for PLC programming. It resembles traditional programming languages and supports structured programming constructs.

3. **Creating a Function Block**: In ST, a function block is created using the `FUNCTION_BLOCK` keyword followed by the block name. It encapsulates variables and logic related to a specific functionality.

4. **Variable Declaration**: Inside the function block, input and output variables are declared using `VAR_INPUT` and `VAR_OUTPUT`. Each variable should be clearly defined with its type.

5. **Implementing Logic**: The negation logic is implemented using the NOT operator. The output variable is assigned the negated value of the input variable.

6. **Finalizing the Block**: The function block is concluded with the `END_FUNCTION_BLOCK` statement, indicating the end of the block's definition.

This guide provides a high-level overview of creating a simple NOT gate function block in Structured Text for PLC programming.
