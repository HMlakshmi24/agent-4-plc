<description>
The problem involves designing a PLC function block in structured text (ST) to manage and increment two variables, aaa and bbb, based on their comparative values. The function block should also keep track of the number of cycles it has executed.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_ValueTracker
    VAR_INPUT
        aaa : DINT := 1;  // Initialize aaa with 1
        bbb : DINT := 0;  // Initialize bbb with 0
        CYCLE : DINT := 0; // Initialize cycle counter
    END_VAR
    VAR_OUTPUT
        OUT : DINT; // Output variable for the difference
        UPDATED_CYCLE : DINT; // Updated cycle count output
    END_VAR

    // Increment logic based on comparative values
    IF aaa = bbb THEN
        aaa := aaa + 1; // Increment aaa if they are equal
    ELSIF aaa > bbb THEN
        bbb := bbb + 1; // Increment bbb if aaa is greater
    ELSE
        aaa := aaa + 1; // Increment aaa if bbb is greater
    END_IF;

    // Calculate the output difference
    OUT := aaa - bbb; // Set OUT to the difference of aaa and bbb
    CYCLE := CYCLE + 1; // Increment the cycle counter
    UPDATED_CYCLE := CYCLE; // Update the output cycle count
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the function block with input and output variables.
2. Implement conditional statements to manage the incrementing of variables aaa and bbb based on their values.
3. Calculate the difference between aaa and bbb and assign it to the output variable OUT.
4. Maintain and increment a cycle counter with each execution of the function block.
5. Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and updated as needed.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used here is a simple control logic that follows a sequence based on conditional statements. This approach is similar to a Decision Tree where different branches are taken based on the conditions evaluated.

Tutorial:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: Clearly define the variables and their roles in the function block. Identify how these variables will interact based on conditions.
2. **Using Conditional Logic**: Implement `IF`, `ELSIF`, and `ELSE` statements to create a flow of logic that determines which variable to increment based on their comparative values.
3. **Variable Management**: Ensure that the variables are initialized correctly and updated based on the logic executed. This includes incrementing the cycle counter.
4. **Testing the Function Block**: After writing the function block, test it in a PLC environment to ensure that it operates as expected. Check the output variable and cycle counter to validate correct behavior.
5. **Iterate**: Based on testing, make adjustments to the logic if necessary to ensure that all edge cases are handled appropriately.

Given a competitive programming problem generate a concrete planning to solve the problem.

# Problem: The problem involves designing a PLC function block in structured text (ST) to manage and increment two variables, aaa and bbb, based on their comparative values. The function block should also keep track of the number of cycles it has executed.
# Planning: 
1. Define the function block `FB_ValueTracker` with the following input variables: `aaa`, `bbb`, and `CYCLE`.
2. Define output variables: `OUT` and `UPDATED_CYCLE`.
3. Initialize `aaa` to 1 and `bbb` to 0 in the VAR_INPUT section.
4. Implement conditional statements to compare the values of `aaa` and `bbb` using `IF`, `ELSIF`, and `ELSE` to determine which variable to increment.
5. Calculate the difference between `aaa` and `bbb`, and assign this value to the output variable `OUT`.
6. Increment the cycle counter `CYCLE` each time the function block is executed.
7. Update the output variable `UPDATED_CYCLE` to reflect the current value of `CYCLE`.
8. Ensure that all variables are accurately managed and updated within the function block.
9. Prepare to test the function block by simulating execution in a PLC environment and verifying correct outputs.
10. Refine the function block logic based on test results to ensure robustness against all possible input scenarios.

## Problem to be solved: The problem involves designing a PLC function block in structured text (ST) to manage and increment two variables, aaa and bbb, based on their comparative values. The function block should also keep track of the number of cycles it has executed.
## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: `aaa = 1`, `bbb = 0`
- Output: `OUT = 1`, `UPDATED_CYCLE = 1`
- Input: `aaa = 2`, `bbb = 1`
- Output: `OUT = 1`, `UPDATED_CYCLE = 2`
- Input: `aaa = 2`, `bbb = 2`
- Output: `OUT = 0`, `UPDATED_CYCLE = 3`
