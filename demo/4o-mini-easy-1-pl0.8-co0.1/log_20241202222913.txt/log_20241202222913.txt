<description>
Design a PLC function block named `LED_Control` that uses logical operations to control an LED based on two input push buttons (PB1 and PB2). The LED should turn on when PB1 is pressed and PB2 is not pressed.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK LED_Control
VAR_INPUT
PB1 : BOOL;  // Input for push button 1
PB2 : BOOL;  // Input for push button 2
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
LED : BOOL;  // Output for LED control
END_VAR

// Logic to determine the LED state
LED := PB1 AND NOT PB2; // LED is ON if PB1 is pressed and PB2 is not pressed
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define the function block `LED_Control` with the necessary input and output variables.
2. Implement the logic inside the function block to control the `LED` output based on the inputs `PB1` and `PB2`.
3. In the logical operation, use the AND operation between `PB1` and the negation of `PB2`.
4. Ensure that the output variable `LED` is updated with the result of the logical operation.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve this problem is a simple logical operation based on Boolean algebra. In this case, we can consider it as a direct application of logical operations where we use AND and NOT operations to derive the output from the inputs.

Tutorial on Logical Operations:
1. **Understand Boolean Variables**: In control systems, Boolean variables can have two states: TRUE (1) or FALSE (0). In this problem, `PB1` and `PB2` are Boolean input variables, and `LED` is a Boolean output variable.
  
2. **Logical Operations**: Familiarize yourself with basic logical operations:
   - **AND**: Returns TRUE only if both operands are TRUE. In this case, `PB1 AND NOT PB2` will be TRUE only if `PB1` is TRUE and `PB2` is FALSE.
   - **NOT**: Returns the opposite of the Boolean value. For example, if `PB2` is TRUE, `NOT PB2` will be FALSE.

3. **Combining Operations**: To evaluate the conditions for the output, combine the AND and NOT operations as needed to reflect the desired logic. 

4. **Implementation**: Use the structured text syntax to define the logic within the function block, ensuring to declare the input and output correctly.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Once the logic is implemented, it should be tested with different scenarios of `PB1` and `PB2` to validate that the `LED` behaves as expected.

# Problem: Design a PLC function block named `LED_Control` that uses logical operations to control an LED based on two input push buttons (PB1 and PB2). The LED should turn on when PB1 is pressed and PB2 is not pressed.
# Planning: 
1. Define the function block `LED_Control`.
2. Declare input variables `PB1` (BOOL) for push button 1 and `PB2` (BOOL) for push button 2.
3. Declare output variable `LED` (BOOL) for LED control.
4. Implement the logic using the statement `LED := PB1 AND NOT PB2;` to control the LED based on the states of the push buttons.
5. Ensure the output variable `LED` accurately reflects the result of the logical operation.
6. Conduct test cases to verify that the LED lights up only when `PB1` is pressed and `PB2` is not pressed.
## Relevant Algorithm to solve the next problem:

## Problem to be solved: Design a PLC function block named `LED_Control`.
## Sample Input/Outputs: 
- Input: `PB1 = TRUE, PB2 = FALSE` → Output: `LED = TRUE`
- Input: `PB1 = FALSE, PB2 = TRUE` → Output: `LED = FALSE`
- Input: `PB1 = TRUE, PB2 = TRUE` → Output: `LED = FALSE`
- Input: `PB1 = FALSE, PB2 = FALSE` → Output: `LED = FALSE`
