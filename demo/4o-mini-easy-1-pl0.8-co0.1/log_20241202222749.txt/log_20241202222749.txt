<description>
The problem is to design a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) that takes an integer input and provides two integer outputs. The first output should be equal to the input value, while the second output should always return a constant value of 43.
</description>
<code>
FUNCTION_BLOCK constantprogram
VAR_INPUT
    i : INT;  // Input value
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    o : INT;  // Output equal to input
    c : INT;  // Constant output
END_VAR

// Main logic of the function block
o := i;   // Assign input value to output 'o'
c := 43;  // Set output 'c' to constant value 43
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
</code>
<planning>
1. Define a function block called 'constantprogram'.
2. Declare an input variable 'i' of type INT.
3. Declare two output variables: 'o' of type INT (to hold the input value) and 'c' of type INT (to hold the constant value).
4. In the main logic section, assign the value of 'i' to 'o'.
5. Set the value of 'c' to 43.
6. Ensure the function block compiles without errors and is ready for use in a PLC program.
</planning>
</problem>

<algorithm>
To solve this problem, a simple **Assignment** algorithm is utilized where the output values are assigned based on the input and a constant. 

### Tutorial for Assignment Algorithm:
1. **Understanding Variables**: In any programming, variables are used to store data. Here, we define input and output variables to hold the values.

2. **Assignment Operation**: The assignment operation is the process of setting a variable to a specific value. This is done using the assignment operator (`:=` in ST).

3. **Constant Values**: A constant is a fixed value that does not change during the execution of the program. In this case, we are using a constant value of 43 for one of the outputs.

4. **Defining the Logic**: In the function block, we define a simple logic where the output 'o' takes the value of the input 'i' and the output 'c' is set to a constant.

This algorithm is straightforward and commonly used in control programming, especially in PLCs, where inputs are processed to produce outputs based on defined logic.

# Problem: The problem is to design a PLC function block in Structured Text (ST) that takes an integer input and provides two integer outputs. The first output should be equal to the input value, while the second output should always return a constant value of 43.
# Planning: 
1. Define a function block named 'constantprogram'.
2. Declare an input variable 'i' of type INT to receive the input value.
3. Declare two output variables: 'o' of type INT to store the output equal to the input, and 'c' of type INT to store the constant output.
4. In the main logic section of the function block, assign the value of the input variable 'i' to the output variable 'o' using the assignment operator `:=`.
5. Assign the constant value 43 to the output variable 'c' using the same assignment operator `:=`.
6. Compile the function block to ensure there are no syntax errors and verify that it is properly configured for integration into a PLC program.
